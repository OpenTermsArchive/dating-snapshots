<p><a href="https://lex.helpscoutdocs.com/article/67-ccpa" target="_blank">Privacy Notice for California Residents</a></p>
<p>The Lex mobile application (the “App”) and website (the “Site” and collectively with the App, the “Services”) are provided by Personal Best, Inc. (“Personals”). We respect your privacy and have designed the Services with your privacy in mind. This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes how we collect, use, and disclose personal information and what choices you have. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We may update or amend this Policy in our sole discretion. We will post the changes on this page and indicate at the top of this page the date the policy was last revised. You are responsible for regularly reviewing the most current version of the Policy, which is available in the Services.&nbsp;We will also notify you of any material changes either through a pop-up notice, email or through other reasonable means.</p><br>
<p><strong>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We receive or collect various personal data when you install and use the Services. This Policy sets out what personal data we may collect, how we process and protect that data and the lawful grounds for that processing. In most cases, the lawful ground will be that the processing: (i) is necessary for our legitimate interests in carrying out our business, including to grow and improve the Services, provided those interests are not outweighed by your rights and interests (“Legitimate Interests”), (ii) is necessary to perform a contract with you (“Contract”), or (iii) we have a legal obligation to carry out the processing (“Legal Obligation”). Where processing is based on your consent (“Consent”), we will identify the processing purposes and provide you with relevant information to make the processing fair and transparent.</p>
<p><strong>Account Credentials</strong></p>
<p>To use the App, you must create an account. When you create an account, we require you to provide your mobile phone number. Once you create an account, we require you to provide your first name, email address, and preferred pronoun(s), as well as to select a username and password. You can also choose to link your App account with your Instagram account. You may also have the option to upload an image to your App account, and may need to allow the App to access the camera and/or photo album on the your phone to do so. Any image you upload will be visible to other users of the App.</p>
<p><strong>Your Location</strong></p>
<p>When you create an account, we ask you to share your location with us through the App in order to use all features. We use your location to determine your distance from other users and to help you find personals and missed connections in your area. We collect this information automatically by collecting your Internet Protocol address and your Unique Device ID. It is possible to opt out of sharing your location at sign up, but app functionality is limited. Read more <a href="https://help.thisislex.app/article/87-do-i-have-to-share-my-location">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Your Posts</strong></p>
<p>When you make a post on Lex, we may retain the post as necessary under applicable law. Posts may contain personal data. You can view your posts and you can choose to delete them from your profile.</p>
<p><strong>Your Messages</strong></p>
<p>When you send a message to other users of the App, we may retain the message as necessary under applicable law. Messages may contain personal data. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Your Contacts</strong></p>
<p>You can invite your contacts to join Lex through the App. While your contacts will be visible within the App, please note that we process that information locally on your device – it does not touch our servers.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Support</strong></p>
<p>You may provide us with information related to your use of the App. For example, you may send us an email with information relating to the performance of the App or other issues. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Device and Connection Information</strong></p>
<p>When you install, access, or use the App, we collect information about your mobile device, such as hardware model, operating system information, IP address, mobile network&nbsp;information, and device identifiers. We collect device location information if you use our location features and for diagnostic and troubleshooting purposes such as if you are having trouble with the App’s location features.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user’s computer which collect and store information. We use cookies to keep you logged in to the App and to identify usage behavior to improve our services. For more information, please see the Cookies Information section below. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Usage Logs</strong></p>
<p>We collect service-related, diagnostic, and performance information. This may include information about your use of the App, log files, performance logs, and diagnostic reports.</p>
<p><b>Financial Information</b></p>
<p>If you purchase our Services, you may be required to provide financial information, such as your credit</p>
<p>card or bank account number, to a third-party payment processor. We do not collect or store such financial information and we are not responsible for the collection or storage of such information by third parties. We will, however, have access to certain information associated with your account should you purchase the Services, including the amount and date of the purchase.</p><br>
<p><strong>HOW WE USE INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We use personal data that we collect in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
 <li>We use your username and/or Instagram handle identify you as a user in the App.</li>
 <li>To provide, update, support, and improve the Services</li>
 <li>To communicate with you. If you contact us, we may use your contact information to respond. We may also contact you to inform you about changes in the Services, our product offerings, and important Services-related notices, such as security and fraud notices.</li>
 <li>If you provide your location, we use it to identify your area in the App and to find personals and missed connections in your area.</li>
 <li>To investigate and help prevent security issues and abuse.</li>
 <li>As otherwise required by applicable law or legal process.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>We may generate information that is aggregated or de-identified so that it is no longer reasonably associated with an identifiable natural person and use it for any legitimate business purpose. We will not re-identify such data.</p>
<p><strong>SHARING INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES</strong></p>
<p>We contract with certain third-party service providers in order to operate and provide features through the Services. We may also allow third parties to place and read their own cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect information through the Services and those service providers may need access to your information, including personal data, to perform fulfillment and other services. For example, our third-party service providers may use these technologies to collect information that helps us with traffic measurement, research, and analytics. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The information collected and stored by third parties remains subject to their policies and practices. We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used.</p>

<p>We may share your information when legally required to do so, at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation or by applicable law, rule or regulation, to verify or enforce compliance with our terms of service and any other policies governing the Services, or to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also may disclose information whenever we believe disclosure is necessary to limit our legal liability; to protect or defend our rights or property; or protect the safety, rights, or property of our users or other third parties.

<p><strong>LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY CONTENT</strong></p>
<p>We may provide links to websites, software, or services owned or operated by third parties (“Third-Party Content”).

<p><strong>INTERNATIONAL TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>The internet is a global environment. Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction through cross-border data transfers (e.g., to the United States of America and other jurisdictions). By using the Services and/or communicating electronically with us, you acknowledge and agree to our processing of your information in this manner, and agree to be bound by all applicable privacy laws. We use reasonable safeguards to permit data transfers to these other jurisdictions and may implement standard contractual clauses, where required, with other companies, binding them to protect the privacy and security of your data.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>We use a variety of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your personal data. However, no method of electronic storage or method of transmission over the internet or phone lines is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the protection of any information against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, or that any information may not be disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others. Consequently, when you transmit your personal data to us, you do so at your own risk. &nbsp; If you create an account via the App, your account information will be password-protected. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your username and password, as well as to your smartphone or other mobile device. We request that you not communicate any confidential or sensitive information to us through email, social media, or any other means. &nbsp; If we learn of a security system breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.
