          exercise of the right to cancel before the cancellation period has expired. There are no separate
          cancellation fees but there are no refunds except as provided herein. We will refund You a pro-rata amount of

          issue the refund using the same means of payment as You used for the initial transaction, unless You have

            not
            allow indemnification for indirect damages, but solely the effective losses and the loss of profits
            directly
            and immediately caused by it.</span>
