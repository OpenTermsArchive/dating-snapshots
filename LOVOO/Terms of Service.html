<p>12.1. Irrespective of the legal grounds, LOVOO is only liable where damages </p>

<p>12.1.2. can be attributed to gross negligence or willful intent on the part of LOVOO.  If, pursuant to the paragraph above, LOVOO GmbH is liable for the breach of an essential contractual obligation in the absence of gross negligence or willful intent, the liability is limited to the extent of damage that LOVOO typically had to expect at the time of contract conclusion based on the circumstances known to it at that time. This also applies in the same way to damages caused by the gross negligence or intent of employees of the representatives of LOVOO, who are not its managing directors or executives. Liability for consequential damages, particularly for loss of profit or compensation for third-party damages, is excluded, unless LOVOO is guilty of willful intent or gross negligence.</p>



<p>12.2. Compensation claims pursuant to the German Product Liability Act and for damages arising from injury to life, body or health remain unaffected by the above limitations of liability. Haftungsbeschränkungen unberührt.</p>

<p>13.1. LOVOO may change these Terms and/or the platform services, or any part of it, if these changes are objectively justified or necessary for legal or regulatory reasons. Such changes can be objectively justified for security reasons (e.g. in the event of technical developments or circumstances that may affect or endanger the provision of the services or systems in accordance with these Terms); to enhance existing features or add additional features to the platform; to reflect advancements in technology and to ensure the ongoing operability of the platform.</p>



<p>13.2. Updates necessary to maintain contractual compliance shall not be considered as a change to the platform.</p>

<p>15.2. The Terms of Use do not restrict the right of the user to invoke the application of local mandatory legislation or a jurisdiction which cannot be amended on the basis of contractual agreements. In this case, the ineffective provision shall be replaced by an effective and enforceable regulation with an effect that comes closest to the economic objective which the parties pursued with the ineffective or unenforceable provision.</p>



<h2 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading" id="_Toc156992005">16. Transfer of the contract</h2>



<p>16.1. On the basis of serious grounds (e.g. discontinuation or fundamental change of LOVOO’s business model, changes in the legal situation that make it impossible for LOVOO to continue Live in its current form), LOVOO may transfer the contractual relationship with the User to a suitable company. A suitable company is only one that, taking into account all circumstances and in particular its financial situation and history, offers the reasonable expectation of a proper continuation of the contractual relationships to the users.</p>



<p>16.2. LOVOO will inform the User about such a planned change of the contractual partner stating the acquiring company and the reasons for the transfer at least 4 weeks in advance. The User may terminate the contractual relationship with LOVOO at any time, with immediate effect and free of charge in accordance with section 7. If the User does not terminate the contractual relationship with LOVOO, the transfer of the contract shall become effective at the time specified to the User in the notice.</p>

<p>17.2. Should individual provisions of this contract be ineffective or unenforceable or become ineffective or unenforceable following conclusion of the contract, the effectiveness of the remainder of the contract shall remain hereby unaffected. The ineffective or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by an effective and enforceable regulation with an effect that comes closest to the economic objective, which the parties pursued with the ineffective or unenforceable provision. The above provisions apply in the event that the contract turns out to be incomplete. In the event of differences between the different language versions, the German version shall prevail.</p>
