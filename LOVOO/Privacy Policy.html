<h1 id="collection-processing-and-use-of-personal-data"><strong>Collection, Processing, and Use of Personal Data</strong></h1>
<p>Personal data is all information pertaining to an identified or identifiable natural person (e.g. name, address, telephone number, date of birth, and email address).</p>
<p>When we process personal data, this means that we collect, store, use this data, forward it to others, or delete it.</p>
<p>LOVOO will only collect and process your personal data in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you visit our website and are not a user.</li>
<li>If you contact us directly.</li>
<li>If you install the LOVOO app.</li>
<li>If you register on LOVOO or subscribe to LOVOO and then use LOVOO.</li>
</ul>
<p>You provide your personal data on a voluntary basis when entering into a contractual relationship with LOVOO or as part of an existing contractual relationship with LOVOO. However, you are required to provide special categories of personal data (e.g. the gender you are interested in, which is data relating to sexual orientation), as well as to answer questions about your LOVOO profile, in order to register on LOVOO. You must make your profile information visible to other LOVOO users in order to use the LOVOO service.</p>
<p>Please note that we provide the LOVOO service in many different countries and the information in your profile is visible to other users in all of these countries. Your profile will be displayed in the country corresponding to your GPS location, provided you have agreed to this, and the search settings of the respective user. If we cannot access your GPS location, we will use your IP address and country code to set your approximate location to your state capital.</p>
<p>The specific data LOVOO collects is outlined below.</p>
<h3 id="data-processing-by-app-stores">Data Processing by App Stores</h3>
<p>If you install the LOVOO app using a third-party app store operator (e.g. Google or Apple), you may have to enter into a usage agreement with the respective app store operator regarding access to its portal. To gain this access, you must have a valid account with the app store operator and an appropriate terminal device (e.g. smartphone); LOVOO has no control over data processing in this context. The app store operator of the respective app platform is the sole data controller. If needed, please contact the app store operator (third-party provider) directly for information about its data processing. In this case, LOVOO is only the data controller when the LOVOO app is used.</p>
<h3 id="what-data-does-lovoo-collect-from-users-in-order-to-fulfill-the-contractual-relationship">What Data Does LOVOO Collect From Users in Order to Fulfill the Contractual Relationship?</h3>

<p><strong>Registration Process</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Username (pseudonym)</li>
<li>City</li>
<li>Date of birth</li>
<li>Gender and gender you are interested in (the gender you are interested in indicates sexual orientation and is therefore a special category of personal data)</li>
<li>Profile picture</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Voluntary Information</strong></p>
<p>You can also enter a variety of voluntary information in your user account, e.g. by uploading additional pictures to your profile, entering information on specific questions, and setting search filters (e.g. age and gender).</p>
<p>This voluntary information is visible to other logged-in LOVOO users on LOVOO, but it can be deleted or modified by the account holder at any time in the user account settings. If the user specifies the gender or age he/she is looking for, only users of this gender or age will be displayed in the dating feature.</p>
<p>This data is specifically used for LOVOO&#39;s feature for selecting recommendations for other user accounts according to different criteria for the user and displaying them on LOVOO. Providing additional information increases your chances of making contact with suitable LOVOO users.</p>
<p><strong>Shared Content</strong></p>
<p>LOVOO users can share content with other users on the platform, for example by sharing content in chat messages.</p>
<p><strong>Information Regarding Sexual Orientation</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Providing the LOVOO platform and rendering the services that are described in our <a href="https://www.lovoo.com/legal/toc">General Terms and Conditions</a>. This specifically includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing our website to non-registered users;</li>

<li>Providing the option of making contact and answering requests via the platform;</li>
<li>Facilitating the conclusion of a contract, including invoicing;</li>
<li>Sending emails and/or push notifications with matches or other messages related to the contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(The legal basis of processing is the fulfillment of the contract with you. In some cases, the legal basis is also your consent. The legal basis is also our legal obligation as well as the legitimate interest in providing customer service and improving the customer experience)</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing a login via the LOVOO platform or the Facebook login. (The legal basis of processing is the fulfillment of our contract.)</li>
<li>Preventing and fighting misuse (particularly to prevent and combat fake profiles, scamming, unlawful acts and spam, as well as ensuring the integrity and stability of the LOVOO platform). LOVOO collects, processes, and uses personal data and geodata, which are collected during your registration and completion of the LOVOO profile, for an automated check as to whether there are indications or data pointing to misuse of LOVOO.

<li>If we process special categories of data pursuant to Article 9 Paragraph 1 of the GDPR, Article 9 Paragraph 2 a) of the GDPR – your consent – and Article 9 Paragraph 2 e) of the GDPR will serve as the legal basis, provided that you have publicly disclosed your sexual orientation (e.g. in your profile text or in a live video).</li>

<p>As a rule, LOVOO will only disclose your personal data to third parties if this is required to fulfill a contract, if we or the third party have a legitimate interest in disclosing the data, if you have provided your consent, or if this is required to fulfill a legal obligation. To the extent that personal data is transferred to third parties on the basis of a legitimate interest, we explain our legitimate interest in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>The following personal data may also be transferred to third parties:</p>
<ul>
<li>to service providers, provided that the data is required to execute a data processing agreement with us;</li>
<li>where required, to providers of marketing tracking technologies and analysis tools (more information on this is available in our <a href="https://www.lovoo.com/legal/cookies">Cookie and Tracking Policy</a>);</li>

<h3 id="service-providers">Service Providers</h3>
<p>LOVOO reserves the right to appoint service providers to collect or process personal data. LOVOO only sends service providers the personal data they need for their specific activity.</p>
<p>If service providers are not identified by name in this Privacy Policy or in our <a href="https://www.lovoo.com/legal/cookies">Cookie and Tracking Policy</a>, LOVOO uses service providers to send emails and push notifications to LOVOO users. Service providers also provide LOVOO with server capacity. If LOVOO users make in-app purchases on LOVOO, buy &quot;credits&quot; or take out subscriptions, they do so using external payment providers. No payment data is collected or processed by LOVOO GmbH when a purchase is made. Depending on the payment method you select during the ordering process, we forward the data collected for the processing of payments (e.g. bank details or credit card data) to the bank responsible for the payment or to payment service providers contracted by us.</p>
<p>In some cases, payment service providers also collect this data themselves under their own responsibility. For instance, this is the case when you make in-app purchases using an app store operator. In this respect, the Privacy Policy of the respective payment service provider or app store operator will apply.</p>
<p>Service providers are generally contracted as processors who may only process the personal data of users of this online service in accordance with LOVOO&#39;s instructions.</p>
<p>At LOVOO, only persons who are required and necessary for the fulfillment of their tasks receive the personal data.</p>

<p>Your personal data may also be disclosed to third parties (jointly or severally with us) or processors located in non-EU/EEA countries. In this case, prior to the transfer, we ensure that the recipient either has an adequate level of data protection (e.g. based on an <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en">adequacy finding of the EU Commission</a> for the respective country pursuant to Article 45 of the GDPR or the agreement of <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en">standard contractual clauses of the European Union</a> with the recipient pursuant to Article 46 of the GDPR while applying additional technical and organizational protection measures) or that sufficient consent has been obtained from our users.</p>
