<p>This privacy statement is valid for the mobile app LOVOO, the site
<a href="https://www.lovoo.com/imprint">www.lovoo.com</a>, and additional services
offered by LOVOO GmbH which refer to this privacy statement.</p>
<p>tl;dr: To summarize, your privacy is important to LOVOO. Thus, we only
use for full personal data for providing the LOVOO platform and product
optimization. We will never share sensitive data like your name profile
picture with third parties for advertising purposes. However, LOVOO is
partially financed by advertising. To be able to show you adverts that
are interesting to you we and/or our advertising partners use your
published age and gender, your coarse location and device and network
information to show you personalized adverts. We only share this data in
pseudonymous form. Pseudonymous means, that we will not share the data
together with your (user) name or your e-mail address or similar data,
just with the Advertiser-ID. All our advertising partners are
contractually and legally forbidden to join the transferred data with
your real name and similar data.</p>
<p>If you want to object against the use of this data for advertising
purposes, you can deactivate personalized advertising in the app setting
under Privacy and in your device settings. On an apple device this can
be done in the iOS preferences, under &quot;Privacy&quot; -- &quot;Ads&quot; and
enabling the option &quot;no ad tracking&quot;; for a user owning an Android
this can be achieved by opening the &quot;Google Settings&quot; (or first
&quot;Settings&quot; and then &quot;Google&quot;), clicking on &quot;Display&quot; and ticking
the option &quot;Disable personalised ads. You can reset the IDFA or the
Advertising ID at any time with these options.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.lovoo.com/imprint">LOVOO GmbH</a>, Prager Stra√üe
10, 01069 Dresden, Germany (&quot;LOVOO GmbH&quot; or &quot;we/us/our&quot;) owns the
domain &quot;<a href="http://www.lovoo.com&quot;">www.lovoo.com&quot;</a> and all of its sub-pages (&quot;LOVOO domain&quot;)
where it provides mobile app LOVOO (&quot;LOVOO app&quot;) available for
download for various operating systems which is its principal means of
running a platform for chatting with, getting to know and meeting other
people (&quot;LOVOO&quot;). LOVOO GmbH is the data controller.</p>
<p>The service offering is based on the freemium model allowing a LOVOO
user (&quot;user&quot; or &quot;you&quot;) to use the LOVOO domain or run the LOVOO app
to create a profile (&quot;user profile&quot;), upload images and exchange news
etc. with other interested users and their user profiles for free. Users
have access to various functions such as Chat, Live Radar, Match Game or
Live-Video and many other LOVOO functions. Added to that, LOVOO offers a
chargeable premium service for users who wish to gain access to further
unique functions.</p>
<p>LOVOO&#39;s offering also lets you meet real people in your area and
therefore classifies as a so-called dating service. Everybody aged 16 or
older may register.</p>
<p>Collecting, processing and using your data is based on the provisions of
the Federal Telemedia Act (TMG) and the data privacy laws, the latter
particularly including the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and as of
25 May 2018 -- the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>This privacy statement explains how we will handle your personal data.
Personal data is discrete information about private or objective
conditions of a specific or identifiable natural person. Personal data
includes, but is not limited to a person&#39;s name, birthday, phone number
or the e-mail address and usage data such as the IP address. Another
purpose of the privacy statement is to inform users about the data
collected, saved and processed and how LOVOO GmbH ensures the protection
and safety of personal data.</p>
<p>LOVOO GmbH does not insist on the use of real names. Users may specify a
nickname instead of their real name. For some parts of LOVOO, e.g. if
you receive money from LOVOO, you may be required to provide us with
your name, your address and your citizenship for tax purposes. In this
case we will inform you about this.</p>

<h3 id="11-lovoo-app-download">1.1. LOVOO app download</h3>
<p>When you download the LOVOO app, the relevant data will be transferred
to the app store operator concerned. Depending on the app store, the set
of data may include the app store user&#39;s e-mail address or customer
number, the time of download and a unique device ID, for example.
However, LOVOO GmbH has no influence on and is not controller for this
data processing. The privacy statements / settings of the relevant app
store operator apply.</p>
<h3 id="12-installation-and-access-rights">1.2. Installation and access rights</h3>
<p>LOVOO needs various access pathways and data to ensure the technical
operability of the LOVOO app and to provide the services you can run

<p>Depending on which operating system you use, the installer may already
ask your permission to access specific functions and pieces of
information. Such access rights cover the location, messages, mobile
data and others.</p>
<p>The user preferences of some terminal devices allow user to manually
withdraw some of these rights. If you do, please bear in mind that not
granting these rights may render the LOVOO app partly or completely
useless. Access rights will be checked before or after the installation,
depending on your app version.</p>

<p>We delete this data when you delete your account. The legal basis for
this processing of personal data is Article 6 (1) b) or Article 6 (1) f) of the EU General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<h4 id="312-optional-details">3.1.2 Optional details</h4>
<p>You may add many optional details to your user profile or enter search parameters. They
particularly help LOVOO to select other user profiles by various
criteria, suggest them to the user and display them in LOVOO. Additional
details increase the probability of getting in touch with matching user
profiles. However, these details are entirely optional, and the user can
see, enter, modify or delete them in the Details section of the profile,</p>
<p>We collect, save and use the data you enter so that you can use LOVOO.</p>

other logged-in LOVOO users, the user owning the affected user profile
can modify or delete them at any time via the Preferences section of the
profile. This data may also be used for ads (see section 4 for information about

<h4 id="314-location-data">3.1.4 Location data</h4>
<p>LOVOO&#39;s offering includes so-called location-based services which
display specific choices tailored to the user&#39;s location. A user can
therefore be shown other users in the vicinity. To be able to provide
these functions within the LOVOO app, LOVOO collects location data by
means of GPS of the terminal device concerned as well as location data
of nearby radio access nodes. Provided that the site survey is enabled,
and permission is granted, the location will be periodically transferred
to LOVOO GmbH and will be respectively processed and used.</p>
<p>Before collection of location data, users must allow the collection of
location data. The location data is then processed in accordance with
this privacy statement. If activated and granted, the location data is
transferred to LOVOO GmbH at regular intervals to be processed and used.</p>
<p>Users can change this functionality at any time by displaying the
Preferences of their terminal device&#39;s operating system at any time to
either allow or disallow the collecting of location data.</p>
<p>Location data will also be used for advertising purposes, if the user
has not objected to this in the app settings. (See section 4 for
information about advertising).</p>
<p>We store location data unshortend for up to 14 days and shortened up to 90 days. The legal basis for this
processing of personal data is Article 6 (1) b) or f) of the EU General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

<p>We keep the users&#39; IP addresses and the associated network data (e.g. the country in which the IP address is registered) for safety and checking purposes. The
aim is to prevent abuse of the service.</p>
<p>This data is used to prevent and fight fake-profiles, illegal activity and spam and to secure the
integrity and stability of the LOVOO platform. For this purpose, we
store the full data up to 90 days, after that until you delete your profile. The legal basis for this processing
of personal data is Article 6 (1) f) of the EU General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>For technical reasons the IP address will be transferred to advertising
partner, see below at 4. LOVOO GmbH has selected its advertising partners
with due diligence to ensure that your privacy is protected by
contractual restrictions and the law.</p>
<h4 id="322-device-data">3.2.2 Device Data</h4>
<p>When using the app or the website, we receive information about the devices used, such as the manufacturer, operating system, advertising ID.</p>
<p>The data is used to prevent and combat fake profiles,
illegal actions and spam as well as the safeguarding of the
integrity and stability of the LOVOO platform.</p>
<p>For this purpose, we store the collected data for up to 90 days in
complete form and delete this data when you delete your user account. The legal basis for this processing of personal data is Art. 6 I f) EU-DSGVO.</p>
<h4 id="323-event-data">3.2.3. Event data</h4>
<p>When using the app or the platform, we receive information about your actions (a so-called event) in the app or on the platform, for example when you search for users by clicking data, a match is created or you send messages.</p>
<p>The data provided will be stored, processed and used by us for the purpose of using LOVOO.  In particular, this serves LOVOO&#39;s function of selecting recommendations for other user profiles according to different criteria for the user and displaying them within LOVOO. This additional information increases the probability of coming into contact with suitable user profiles.  This data is an important part of understanding which profiles are likely to be of interest to you and which profiles you would like us to display.</p>
<p>This data is also stored, processed and used to prevent and combat fake profiles, illegal actions and spam as well as to ensure the integrity and stability of the LOVOO platform.</p>
<p>We delete this data when you delete your user account.</p>
<p>The legal basis for this processing of personal data is Art. 6.

<h3 id="33-payment-data">3.3 Payment data</h3>
<p>External payment service providers handle the transactions involved when
a user does any In-App purchases via LOVOO, buys credits or subscribes
to our chargeable premium service. LOVOO GmbH neither collects nor
processes any payment data of shopping transactions. Instead, the
payment service providers take care of entering and processing the
payment data directly. All that LOVOO GmbH and the payment service
providers do is to exchange technical data (e.g. the transaction ID) in
order to validate the purchases. We save this data until your user
account is deleted or beyond this point, until a time when the data is
no longer subject to any tax-related, commercial or other statutory
storage obligations. The legal basis for this processing of personal
data is Article 6 (1) b) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR).</p>
<h2 id="4-how-does-lovoo-use-my-data-for-advertising">4. How does LOVOO use my data for advertising?</h2>
<p>We use data for adveristing in two regards:</p>
<ol>
<li>For our own advertising</li>
<li>To display personalized advertising.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="41-how-is-my-data-used-for-lovoos--own-advertising">4.1 How is my data used for LOVOO&#39;s  own advertising?</h3>
<p>We display ads of our own to our users on our platform and also inform them by e-mail, e.g. about one-off campaigns, discounted package prices or similar offers. In order to be able to display suitable offers, we use information provided by the user (such as profile data) and information that we automatically receive through the use of our platform.</p>
<p>The user can object to the use for advertising purposes at any time by deactivating personalised advertising in the app settings under Privacy and or in his device settings or in the settings on the website.</p>
<p>The data transfer takes place exclusively as described under 6.</p>
<p>The legal basis for this processing is the legitimate interest of LOVOO according to Art. 6 I lit. f DSGVO.</p>
<h4 id="411-audiences">4.1.1. Audiences</h4>
<p>We also use Audience offers from the following providers for our own advertising:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/customaudience">Facebook Audiences</a></li>
<li>Snapchat Audiences</li>
</ul>
<p>herinafter Audience Providers.</p>
<p>For this purpose, we transfer the e-mail addresses of selected users to the AudienceAprovider in a hashed form. This means that the email address <a href="mailto:max.mustermann@lovoo.com">max.mustermann@lovoo.com</a> will be transmitted as 73b6756115fdeba0f42b63649d986d5c8d60932e890c0355308967c10f72d058. The Audience Provider will never receive the email address in plain text. This hashed email address is used by the Audience Provider to dsiplay our advertisements to people who have a similar profile as the user.</p>
<p>The user can object to this at any time by deactivating personalized advertising in the app settings under Privacy and or in his device settings or in the settings on the website.</p>
<p>The legal basis for this processing is the legitimate interest of LOVOO according to Art. 6 I lit. f DSGVO.</p>
<h3 id="42-how-does-lovoo-use-my--data-for-personlized-advertising">4.2. How does LOVOO use my  data for personlized advertising?</h3>
<p>LOVOO GmbH decided to run LOVOO as a freemium service which lets every
user obtain a basic LOVOO version free of charge. Users of the free
version will be shown ads. The ads shown in LOVOO contain our own
advertising matters (such as the premium products of LOVOO) or content
ordered by an advertising firm in so-called campaigns. Campaigns may be
personalised to tailor them to specific user groups (e.g., ads for
cosmetic products just for female or male users; skateboard ads only for
persons under 25, etc.). Some ads shown in LOVOO are mediated by
external service providers.</p>
<h3 id="421-which-data-is-used-for-advertising-and-who-is-it-given-to">4.2.1. Which data is used for advertising and who is it given to?</h3>
<p>LOVOO GmbH can use LOVOO to show third-party ads which may be tailored
to the users&#39; assumed specific interests (personalised ads) or targeted
to certain user groups grouped by age, location or gender. The users can
object to the use of its data in the privacy settings of the app. We and
our advertising partners will only use non-sensitive data, that the you
have published on LOVOO and information about your device and your
connection. Under no circumstances will we share your name, your e-mail
address, your profile picture or your exact location or similar data
that allows a direct inference of your real person with our advertising
partners.</p>

<h3 id="422-what-is-an-advertiser-id-and-how-is-it-used">4.2.2. What is an advertiser ID and how is it used?</h3>
<p>For tracking and advertising, the LOVOO app uses the so-called
advertiser ID, i.e. the &quot;Advertiser Identifier&quot; (IDFA) for offerings
of Apple Inc. and the &quot;Android Advertiser ID&quot; (advertiser ID) for
offerings of Google. Inc. (jointly the &quot;<strong>advertiser ID(s)</strong>&quot;). These
advertiser IDs are unique non-permanent numbers identifying a specific
terminal device. They are provided by iOS for offerings of Apple Inc. or
by Android for offerings of Google Inc. As opposed to vendor advertiser
IDs (generated by latest-generation operating systems and identical for
the apps of just one provider), the advertiser ID is the same as the one
transferred to other companies when running their apps. The user can
deactivate the generation of the Advertiser-ID. On an apple device this
can be done in the iOS preferences, under &quot;Privacy&quot; -- &quot;Ads&quot; by
enabling the option &quot;no ad tracking&quot;; for a user owning an Android
this can be achieved by opening the &quot;Google Settings&quot; (or first
&quot;Settings&quot; and then &quot;Google&quot;), clicking on &quot;Display&quot; and ticking
the option &quot;Disable personalised ads. The Advertiser ID is pseudonymous
and LOVOO GmbH will not be joined with other user data to identify him
for advertising purposes.</p>
<p>The Advertiser ID will be used by LOVOO GmbH and our advertising partner
as described above to show you personalized advertising and to analyse
this advertising. You can always object to this pseudonymous use by
disabling the Advertiser ID as described above or objecting in the
privacy settings of our app.</p>

<h3 id="423-using-location-data">4.2.3. Using location data</h3>
<p>Apart from collecting the location data by running GPS Location (see
section 3.3) to enable the location-based services, LOVOO GmbH collects
and uses other location data to show the user ads in LOVOO tailored to
the user&#39;s location and profile. LOVOO GmbH will never forward the
exact location to our advertising partners. To protect your privacy all
provided location data is coarse by around 2 km. To our knowledge with
this data the identification of an individual is not or only with an
unreasonable and illegal measures possible.</p>
<p><strong>For users that are sensitive to privacy question, we offer a separate
option in the apps privacy settings to object of the use of location
data for the future.</strong></p>

<p>LOVOO GmbH bases the processing of sharing of the above data on the
performance of the contract with you (Article 6 (1) b) GDPR in
connection with Nr. 11.2. of our Terms of Service), your consent (Article 6 (1) a) GDPR) and the legitimate interests pursued by us (Article 6 (1) f) GDPR).</p>
<p>We offer our users a service under the Freemium model, which means, that
certain parts of LOVOO are free to use. In Exchange for using the LOVOO
platform without charge, LOVOO GmbH displays personalized advertisings
and process and shares pseudonymous data as specified above.</p>
<p>Pre-requirement for all data transfer is that the recipient ensures by
contractual, legal, technical and organizational measure that the data
processing is always in compliance with privacy law.</p>
<p>The users consents to the data use and transfer to the recpients above when using the free version of the app.</p>
<p>We have decided to only share data, which -- even in the event of an
unlawful disclosure or by hacking of our partners -- is not sensitive
for individual users. We thus only share data in pseudonymous form and
only data that the user has made public or is -- by its nature -- not
sensitive like device and network data.</p>
<p>LOVOO will only pass on data that has been voluntarily made public on the LOVOO platform by the user and therefore shows a low level of sensitivity to the user and device or connection data which, due to their very nature, have are not sensitive.</p>

<h3 id="51-cookies-and-cookie-policy">5.1 Cookies and cookie policy</h3>
<p>The LOVOO domain uses cookies to make using the LOVOO domain a very
comfortable experience. Cookies are small text files temporarily stored
locally by the Internet browser (so-called session cookies) or on the
hard disk of either the mobile device or the computer (so-called
permanent cookies). You can set your browser application to refusing to
accept cookies or to asking you before a cookie is accepted. If cookies
are accepted, the user is assigned an alias ID. A cookie neither runs
programs on the user&#39;s terminal device nor does it transfer viruses.
Session cookies are temporarily stored and deleted when you end your
browser session.</p>
<p>LOVOO GmbH also uses cookies to increase the safety of the LOVOO domain,
e.g. to authenticate a user during a session in order to avoid
cross-site scripting or to prevent phishing and scamming.</p>
<p>In the name of LOVOO GmbH, tracking/analysis services providers (for
details see section 5.2 Tracking and analysis services providers) upload
cookies to a user&#39;s device in order to capture that user&#39;s usage data.
This set of data includes details collected while the user is browsing
the pages of the LOVOO or other domain or clicking on ad banners. These
cookies are used to display tailored ads, optimise advertising campaign
reports and to avoid repeatedly showing the same ads.</p>
<p>Users have the option to influence the usage of cookies, most browsers
provide a setup option for restricting or completely prohibiting the
saving of cookies. Please note, though, that disabling the use of

<h3 id="52-tracking-analysis-service-and-security-providers">5.2 Tracking, analysis service and security providers</h3>
<p>By analysing what its visitors do, LOVOO optimises its services and how
they are offered. To this end, LOVOO GmbH deploys methods able to
analyse visits to the LOVOO domain or the LOVOO app. We also use
tracking tools provided by third parties in order to analyse the reach
of various advertising and marketing campaigns. Running third-party
tools may involve the transfer of personal data.</p>
<p>While data processing mainly helps to troubleshoot LOVOO, it is also
important for optimising LOVOO and adapting it to its users&#39; needs. Web
analysis provides further details which are useful for LOVOO GmbH to
obtain key facts about the number of visitors and how they distribute
over time, about favourite content and the time users spend on our site.
It may sometimes be possible or necessary to verify whether a user
profile was created in response to a specific promotional activity. The
data is further used for fraud and spam prevention. To actually analyse
the user data, it is transferred to various third-party providers.</p>
<p>LOVOO currently uses the following analysis and tracking services
providers:</p>
<p><strong>Crashlytics (Fabric)</strong></p>
<p>The LOVOO app runs the analysis tool &quot;Crashlytics&quot; (Fabric) supplied
by Crashlytics, 1 Kendall Square, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
(&quot;<strong>Crashlytics</strong>&quot;). This analysis utility uses the users&#39; IP
addresses albeit always after making them anonymous. It is therefore
impossible to trade an address back to a real person. Crashlytics
provides LOVOO GmbH with real-time analyses of system crashes which is a
great help in maintaining and improving the LOVOO app or LOVOO domain.
Details transferred are one user ID, the clicks as well as technical
device data needed to analyse the error.</p>
<p>For further data protection details, read the privacy policy of
Crashlytics:
<a href="http://try.crashlytics.com/terms/">http://try.crashlytics.com/terms/</a></p>
<p>The main purpose of tracking and the analysis of user behaviour that
this entails is to fulfil our contractual obligations, especially to
reduce crashes, bugs and to improve our product. The legal basis for
this processing of personal data is Article 6 (1) b) of the EU General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>
<p>LOVOO runs &quot;<strong>Google Analytics</strong>&quot; supplied by Google Inc., 1600
Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (&quot;<strong>Google</strong>&quot;).
LOVOO GmbH wishes to make you aware of the fact that, in LOVOO, Google
Analytics has been extended by IP masking function
&quot;_gat._anonymizeIp&quot; which ensures that IP addresses are made
anonymous first.</p>
<p><em>Please note the following details regarding the use of Google
Analytics:</em></p>
<p>Google Analytics uses cookies to enable the analysis of how LOVOO is
used. As a rule, the cookie transfers the details of how you use LOVOO
to a Google server in the US and stores them there. First of all, and
provided that IP anonymisation is enabled, however, Google shortens your
IP address used within the EU Member States or within other members of
the Treaty on the European Economic Area. In the name of LOVOO GmbH,
Google will use these details to analyse how you use our service, to
compile activity reports and to provide the operator with other services
linked to your use of LOVOO.</p>
<p>We only use Google Analytics with the user&#39;s consent, by allowing us to
set the necessary cookies. We save this data for 26 months. The legal
basis for this processing of personal data is Article 6 (1) a) of the EU
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p><strong>Adjust</strong></p>
<p>LOVOO uses &quot;adjust&quot;, an app usage analysis tool supplied by adjust
GmbH, Saarbr√ºcker Str. 37 a in 10405 Berlin, Germany. When installing
the LOVOO app, adjust will save installation and event data of your iOS
or Android app. This helps us understand how our users are interacting
with the LOVOO app. It also allows us to analyse and improve our mobile
advertising campaigns. Analysis by adjust is based on the IDFA or the
Advertiser ID as well as your anonymous IP and MAC address. This
unilaterally anonymous data disallows to identify you or your mobile
device. In case you wish to disable tracking by adjust, please go to

<h2 id="8-how-is-data-deleted-and-back-ups-created">8. How is data deleted and back-ups created?</h2>
<p>Deleting a user profile (attention: not by deleting the LOVOO app!) or

following data:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Payment data and data regarding reward claims, which we have to retain
for tax-related, commercial or other statutory storage obligations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Data, which you have shared with other users in chats, like messages
or pictures (see below)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When do we delete data, that you have shared with other users?</strong></p>
<p>We delete data which is accessible in your public profile, like profile
pictures, stream pictures and profile data, promptly as specified above.</p>
<p>We can&#39;t delete data that you have shared non-publicly with other users
without infringing the rights of this other user. Thus, we can delete
chat data only after both users have delete their profile.</p>
<p><strong>How long will it take to delete the data?</strong></p>
<p>Such details will be immediately removed from the productive databases
and, thus from the LOVOO interface; however, it may take up to 14 days
until the data is removed from all of LOVOO&#39;s server layers, cache
memories and back-up databases.</p>
<p>If deletion is not possible, we will anonymize the data or restrict the
processing.</p>
<p><strong>In case certain facts lead to the suspicion that a user profile uses
LOVOO illegally or contrary to the contract with us, we reserve the
right to check and perhaps save profile files before deleting them. This
is to protect the users of LOVOO GmbH&#39;s offerings.</strong></p>
<p>Irrespective of data deleted because of user-deleted profiles, LOVOO
automatically and periodically deletes historical data no longer needed
to perform the contract (e.g. historical location details and IP data).</p>
<p>In order to protect its datasets, LOVOO GmbH creates so-called back-up
copies which are overwritten and, thus, deleted for good after 14 days.
Deletion also affects log files that may be contained in these back-ups.
Log files will also be deleted when a user profile is completely
deleted.</p>
<h2 id="9-how-does-lovoo-ensure-data-integrity">9. How does LOVOO ensure data integrity?</h2>
<p>The trust of its users and protecting their data is of great importance
to LOVOO GmbH. To prevent unauthorised access to or disclosure of user
data and to ensure the integrity and appropriate use of the data, LOVOO
GmbH has appropriate physical, technical and administrative procedures
in place to protect the information collected by LOVOO GmbH.</p>
<p>To provide highest-level protection of the user data, the offerings of
the LOVOO domain or LOVOO app rely on a secure SSL connection that
allows the transfer of nothing but encrypted data.</p>
