<p>• You and we acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party claim that the App Store Sourced Application or your possession and use of that App Store Sourced Application infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, as between HER and the App Store Owner, HER, not the App Store Owner, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by this Agreement.</p>
<p>• You and we acknowledge and agree that the App Store Owner, and the App Store Owner’s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement as related to your license of the App Store Sourced Application, and that, upon your acceptance of this Agreement, the App Store Owner will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the terms of this Agreement as related to your license of the App Store Sourced Application against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.</p>

<h3>Anti-Spam</h3>
<p>HER prohibits the sending of unsolicited bulk email or text messages (spam).

HER also prohibits using false headers in emails or falsifying, forging, or altering the origin of any email or text message in connection with HER and/or any products and Services.

<h3>Enforcement of Terms</h3>
<p>Even if we delay in enforcing these Terms, we can still enforce them later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these Terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking these Terms, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things, and it will not prevent us from taking steps against you at a later date.</p>
<h3>Rights and Waiver</h3>
<p>No delay or omission by either party hereto to exercise any right or power occurring upon any noncompliance or default by the other party with respect to any of the terms of this Agreement shall impair any such right or power or be construed to be a waiver thereof.

            <h2 class=" title-h2">Arbitration Agreement and Dispute Resolution.</h2>
          </div>
                    <div class="content-module__content">
            <h3>Arbitration Agreement</h3>
<p>Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with Bloomer, Inc. (doing business as HER) and affects your rights. It contains procedures for mandatory binding arbitration and a class action waiver.</p>
<h3> Scope</h3>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Website or to any other aspect of your relationship with HER will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or HER may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement. Now or in the future, there may be lawsuits against HER alleging class, collective, and/or representative claims. Such claims, if successful, could result in some monetary recovery to you. The existence of such class, collective, and/or representative lawsuits does not mean that such lawsuits will ultimately succeed. But if you agree to arbitration with HER, you are agreeing in advance that you will not participate in or seek to recover monetary or other relief under such class, collective, and/or representative lawsuits. Instead, by agreeing to arbitration, you may bring your claims against HER in an individual arbitration proceeding. If successful on such claims, you could be awarded money or other relief by an arbitrator.</p>
<h3>Arbitration Rules and Forum</h3>
<p>Arbitration Rules and Forum. This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act in all respects. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent, The Corporation Trust Company, at 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, DE 19801. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA’s rules are available at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitration fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, HER will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.</p>
<h3>Arbitrator Powers</h3>
<p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and HER. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding on you and HER.</p>
<h3>Waiver of Jury Trial</h3>
<p>You and HER each knowingly and voluntarily waive any constitutional and statutory rights to sue in court and receive a judge or jury trial. You and HER are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. In any litigation between you and HER over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, you and HER waive all rights to a jury trial and elect instead to have a judge resolve the dispute.</p>
<h3>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions</h3>
<p>All claims and disputes within the scope of this arbitration agreement must be arbitrated on an individual basis and not on a class basis. Claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or litigated jointly or consolidated with those of any other customer or user. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor HER is entitled to arbitration. Instead, all claims and disputes will then be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 14 (Exclusive Venue) below.</p>
<h3>Opt Out</h3>
<p>You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you do so, neither you nor HER can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify HER in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your HER username (if any), the email address you used to set up your HER account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. You must send your opt-out notice to: hello@weareher.com and 1760 Mission Street, San Francisco, CA, 94103. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.</p>
<h3>Survival of Arbitration Agreement</h3>
<p>This Arbitration Agreement will survive any termination of your relationship with HER.</p>
<h3>Exclusive Venue</h3>
<p>To the extent the parties are permitted under this Agreement to initiate litigation in a court, both you and HER agree that all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Agreement will be litigated exclusively in the state or federal courts located in the applicable county within the State of California.</p>
<p>Please print a copy of this Agreement for your records and check back frequently for any changes to this Agreement.</p>
