<div class="content" id="article_content"><h1>Match community guidelines</h1>
<p>Match is a service intended for singles who are looking for genuine, committed people who are ready to start a serious relationship.</p>
<p>We want you to have a great time and get the best dating experience. To make that happen, we ask all our users to take responsibility for their behaviour here and the ways they interact with other members.</p>
<h3>The golden rule</h3>
<p>The most important thing to remember when you’re on our site/app is this:</p>
<p><em>If you wouldn’t say, do or show something to a date in real life, don’t say, do or show it here.</em></p>
<p>So before you send a message, ask a question or upload a photo, always ask yourself if you would do the same if you were meeting in real life. If you wouldn’t, it’s probably not a good idea to do it online.</p>
<h3>The four pillars of online behaviour</h3>
<p>There are four key principles we want you to follow while you’re part of our community.</p>
<p><strong>Be kind<br />
Be respectful<br />
Be safe<br />
Be genuine<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Check out the Tips on how to act.</p>
<h3>Being kind</h3>
<p>ALWAYS treat people you interact with on Match the way you would like to be treated yourself.</p>
<p>Don’t be rude. Don’t be mean. Don’t bully, intimidate, defame, harass or stalk other members. If someone says they’re not interested, leave them alone. If someone blocks you, don’t try to get back in touch: Even if you don’t think you did anything wrong, the best plan is to forget it and move on.</p>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Be careful what you say, especially at first. Something you might think is just a joke may be taken very personally by someone else.</li>
<li>Nobody finds threats, hate speech, racism or bigotry attractive, they’re illegal and we take reports of such things very seriously. Depending on the severity, they may lead to your account being warned or banned.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Being respectful</h3>
<p>Every strong relationship is built on mutual respect, and it pays to show that respect right from the start.</p>
<p>Think of your profile picture and username as your first message to someone. So choose a name that makes a positive first impression, and a photo that makes the right person want to find out more. If your name, picture or message contains hate speech, obscenity or trolling it won’t just mean you’re unlikely to get any dates: we’ll ban you from the site.</p>
<p>We’re all adults, and singles may send flirty and even sexy messages to each other. But only when it’s consensual. Don’t send messages containing unwelcome sexual propositions or sexually explicit content, particularly at the start of a relationship.</p>
<p>We also do not accept messages or content depicting illegal activity or promoting commercial sexual services, human trafficking or non-consensual sexual acts. Breaking this rule will result in your account being removed.</p>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Never ask for or share private information.</li>
<li>Sending sexy photos, or talking about kinks or fantasies can be fun, but not right at the start of a relationship. Let things develop first.</li>
<li>It’s never OK to upload nudity, sexually explicit or pornographic content to Match.</li>
<li>Avoid out of context shirtless or bikini photos (it’s OK to wear a bikini in a photo taken on the beach, but in your bedroom it just looks weird).</li>
<li>NO images of violence, drug use or criminal activity: nobody’s impressed.</li>
<li>Please respect your children’s privacy and safety. Photos showing minors, even with an accompanying adult will be removed.</li>
<li>Match is not the place to advertise your business, your band, your artwork or that old fridge you’re selling. Spammers will be banned.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Being safe</h3>
<p>The golden rule for being safe on Match is always to think about your safety first. Only interact with people through the Match app or site, don’t share too much too soon, and never give out your address, email or phone number to anyone you don’t fully trust. Watch out too for people you have never met who ask you for money. Remember scammers can often be very convincing. Don’t let yourself be fooled.</p>
<p>This is a dating site, not an e-commerce site. Never solicit another member for private information, like passwords, Social Security Number, financial information or their home or work address. You are not allowed to use any information regarding a member, public or private, for business/commercial use or any other unlawful or nefarious purpose.</p>
<p>We only accept adults as members, and we will remove and permanently ban any accounts operated by anyone who is not an adult. If you find someone underage, please report their account to us immediately for your safety and theirs.</p>
<p>If you do encounter anyone who makes you feel uncomfortable or who isn’t sticking to our rules, it’s easy to report them. Just click ‘report member’ on their profile. And if you don’t want to hear from them again, you can always block them.</p>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the early stages, keep all your interactions on the site. You’re both much safer that way.</li>
<li>Don’t pressure people into giving your personal information. Remember they don’t know you, and it might make them feel uncomfortable. Get to know them first: they’ll share when they’re ready.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Being genuine</h3>
<p>If you’re after a one night stand, an affair or a secret life, Match isn’t the place for you. Our community is about being yourself, finding someone special and, hopefully, starting something real. So be genuine from the start. It goes without saying that we will ban any scammers, impersonators, fraudsters or criminals and may report them to the police.</p>
<p>Don’t promote external links, sites, pages or any commercial messages in your profile or messaging. And don’t use copyrighted images that belong to someone else unless you have received their express permission. Please note that all responsibility for any use of copyright images without permission and for any other content you share lies wholly with you the user.</p>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make sure all the information on your profile is true, including your age and height. It’s disrespectful not to be honest from the start, and it breaks our terms and conditions.</li>
<li>Only include pictures of yourself, and show your face clearly. Don’t include group photos: people won’t know which face is yours.</li>
<li>Avoid using memes or heavy filters that distort or hide your face. People want to know what you look like!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Behave yourself, online and in real life</h3>
<p>We want our singles to meet eventually, whether it’s on a date or at one of our Match events. And we want you to stay kind, safe, respectful and genuine right through your dates and relationships – it’s just the best way to be.</p>
<p>If someone you’ve met through Match acts badly towards you or makes you uncomfortable, we want to hear about it. Contact <a href="/faq/">customer services</a> and we’ll do our best to help.</p>
<h3>Cyber-bullying leads nowhere. Least of all to love.</h3>
<p>At Match, we say cyberbullying is when a person sends messages repeatedly to the same person despite not getting a response.</p>
<p>These messages can undermine people&#8217;s happiness, dignity and mental health through their repetitive nature and the use of insulting, discriminatory and defamatory content, or of a sexual nature without mutual consent.</p>
<p>In order to fight against this type of behaviour, here are the rules you should follow:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule 1. Wait</strong> for the other person to respond, or not if they choose.</li>
<li><strong>Rule 2</strong>. Replying once is fine, twice is fine, <strong>three times is too much.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Rule 3. Respect</strong> the other person: don’t use insulting or denigrating words or send unsolicited inappropriate photos.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you receive pushy messages which make you feel uncomfortable, here&#8217;s how to alert us so it stops immediately:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Report a profile</strong> direct from your mailbox to alert our moderation and safety team. Every report is dealt with as quickly as possible: from sending a warning to permanent deletion of the profile.</li>
<li><strong>Block a profile</strong> so that person can no longer contact you.</li>
</ul>
