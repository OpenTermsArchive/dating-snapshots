<p>______</p>
<p>Hey there! Welcome to Match’s Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We know reading a privacy policy might not be everyone’s idea of a good time, but hear us out. We put a lot of effort into making this policy as clear and engaging as possible, because we actually want you to read it! Think of us as your digital wingmate, here to guide you through the ins and outs of what data we collect, and why and how we use it. So get cozy, grab your favorite drink , and let’s make privacy make sense – together.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies from <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->01/02/2026. The previous version, available <a href="https://uk.match.com/pages/misc/privacy_012026">here</a>, applies until then.</p>

<h3 id="CH1">1. Who We Are</h3>
<p>The company responsible for your data (the “data controller”) is:</p>
<p>Meetic S.A.S.<br />
MATCH<br />
53 rue de Châteaudun Paris 9 France</p>
<h3 id="CH2">2. Where This Privacy Policy Applies</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services we operate under the Match brand. Whether you&#8217;re searching for your soulmate, joining us at one of our events, or using any of our other awesome services, this Policy has got you covered. For simplicity, we just refer to all of these as our “service” in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If for some reason, one of our services requires its own separate privacy policy, then that policy will be made available to you and that policy—not this Privacy Policy—will apply.</p>
<h3 id="CH3">3. Data We Collect</h3>
<p>It goes without saying, we can’t help you develop meaningful connections without you providing some information about yourself, like basic profile details and the types of people you’d like to meet. Using our service also generates some information, such as when you logged in and how you used the service, as well as the insights and inferences we generate based on the content you provide. We also collect data from third parties, like when you access the service through an account you have on another platform (e.g., Facebook, Google or Apple) or when you upload information from your account on another platform to complete your profile. If you&#8217;re interested in all the details, be sure to check out the table below.</p>

<p>Match is part of the <a href="https://mtch.com/ourcompany">Match Group family of businesses</a>.</p>
<p>We share data about you with our Affiliates and they share data about you with us, for the reasons laid out below:</p>
<ul>
<li>To make all Match Group platforms safer, for instance by searching for and identifying bad actors and how they operate across Match Group platforms, as well as making sure that when a bad actor is found on one Match Group platform (for instance ours), they can be banned from all.</li>
<li>To assist each other, as service providers, in data processing operations, such as data hosting and maintenance, customer care, marketing and targeted advertising, analytics, machine learning development and implementation, finance and accounting, legal support, payment processing, service improvement, data security and fighting against spam, abuse, fraud and other wrongdoings.</li>
<li>To suggest to you relevant and meaningful connections, by developing or improving Match Group Brands’ core recommendation systems.</li>
<li>To improve your chances at building significant connections with others, we may make you visible on other Match Group services or allow you to benefit from cross-platform functionalities.</li>
<li>Where and as allowed under applicable law, to better understand how people use Match Group services overall, to personalize your experience across Match Group services and to enhance marketing and advertising campaigns.</li>
<li>For other legitimate business purposes including corporate / consolidated audit, analysis and reporting.</li>

<h3 id="CH7">7. Cross-Border Data Transfers</h3>
<p>Because we operate a global service, the sharing of your data laid out in Section 5 involves cross-border data transfers to our Affiliates and service providers (other third parties) in third countries that have different privacy laws. When we transfer personal data to a third-country we use appropriate mechanisms. For example, we rely on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adequacy decisions issued by the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en">European Commission</a> or other competent authorities under applicable laws. We transfer personal data to our Affiliates to perform important functions, as outlined in Section 6, by storing, accessing or otherwise processing data and to third-parties in countries with adequacy decisions for the purposes outlined in Section 5.</li>
<li><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en">Standard contractual clauses</a> issued by the European Commission or similar contractual data transfer mechanisms approved by other competent authorities under applicable laws. These contractual data transfer mechanisms are commitments between companies transferring personal data, binding them to protect the confidentiality and security of your data and ensuring adequate level of protection in third countries. We rely on such mechanisms to transfer personal data to our Affiliates to perform important functions, as outlined in Section 6, by storing, accessing or otherwise processing data, and to third parties for the purposes outlined in Section 5 in countries without adequacy decisions, such as the United States of America. <a href="https://uk.match.com/faq/#privacyRequest">Contact us</a> for a copy.</li>

<p>We want you to be in control of your data, so we want to remind you of the following rights, options and tools available to you. Depending on where you live, these rights may not apply to you or they may be named differently. If you have any questions on your rights and how to exercise them, please contact us <a href="https://uk.match.com/faq/#privacyRequest">here</a>.</p>
<p>For your protection and the protection of all of our members, we may ask you for information to verify your identity or authority to act on behalf of a member before we can answer the above requests. We wouldn’t want someone else to get in control of your data!</p>
<p>Keep in mind, we can reject requests, including if we are unable to authenticate you, if the request is unlawful or invalid, or if it could infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy or other rights of someone else. If you wish to receive information relating to another member, the other member will have to make a request themselves.</p>
<p>In certain countries, including in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, you have a right to a judicial remedy and to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal data. You can find information about your data protection regulator in the European Economic Area <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en">here</a>, and in the United Kingdom <a href="https://ico.org.uk/">here</a>. The data protection authority you can lodge a complaint with can be that of your habitual residence, where you work or where an alleged infringement took place.</p>
<h3 id="CH9">9. How Long We Retain Your Data</h3>
<p>We want the connections you make through our service to last forever, but we keep your personal data only as long as necessary for legitimate business reasons (as laid out in Section 4) and as permitted by applicable law.</p>
<p>If you decide to stop using our service, you can close your account and your profile will no longer be visible to other members. Note that we will close your account automatically if you are inactive for two years.</p>
<p>Following account closure, we delete your data as laid out below:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>To protect the safety and security of our members, we implement a safety retention window of three months following account closure. During this period, we keep your data to investigate unlawful or harmful conducts. The retention of data during this safety retention window is based on our legitimate interest as well as that of potential third-party victims.</li>
<li>We maintain limited data to comply with legal data retention obligations: in particular, we keep transaction data for 10 years to comply with tax and accounting legal requirements, credit card information for the duration the user can challenge the transaction, and “traffic data” / logs for one year to comply with legal data retention obligations. We also keep records of consents members give us for five years to comply and evidence our compliance with applicable law.</li>
<li>We maintain limited data on the basis of our legitimate interest: we keep user generated content associated with banned account for two years; customer care records and supporting data for six years from the date of the communication, imprecise location of download/purchase for five years in support of our safety efforts, to support our customer care decisions, enforce our rights and enable us to defend ourselves in the event of a claim; profile data for one year in anticipation of potential litigation, for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; and data necessary to prevent members who were banned from opening a new account for as long as necessary to ensure the safety and vital interests of our members.</li>
<li>Finally, we maintain data on the basis of our legitimate interest where there is an outstanding or potential issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep data, in particular if we receive a valid legal subpoena or request asking us to preserve data (in which case we would need to keep the data to comply with our legal obligations) or if data would otherwise be necessary as part of legal proceedings.</li>
</ol>
<p>Where appropriate and as legally permitted, we may maintain and use data that, by itself, cannot identify or be attributed specifically to you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including to improve our service and create new features, technologies and services, including through machine learning, and keep Match Group services safe.</p>
<h3 id="CH10">10. Children&#8217;s Privacy</h3>
<p>Our service is restricted to individuals who are 18 years of age or older. We do not permit individuals under the age of 18 on our platform. If you suspect that a member is under the age of 18, please use the reporting mechanism available on the service.</p>
<h3 id="CH11">11. Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>This policy will change over time. We’re always looking for new and innovative ways to help you build meaningful connections and strive to make sure explanations of our data practices remain up-to-date. We will notify you before material changes take effect so that you have time to review the changes.</p>
