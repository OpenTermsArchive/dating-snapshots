By using our website, located at http://www.coffeemeetsbagel.com (“Website”), our mobile application available on Android and iOS devices (each, our “App”), and/or other services we provide (collectively, the “Services”) you agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you do not agree to be bound by this Agreement, you may not use the Services. Your use of, or participation in, certain Services may be subject to additional terms which will be presented to you when you access those Services.</p>
<h5>1. Some initial things we want to make clear.</h5>
<p>While all of these will be discussed in more detail below, we want to make a few important things clear up front:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must be at least 18 to use the Services.</li>
<li>You may only create an Account for your actual self and must be truthful in what you put in it.</li>
<li>We do not routinely conduct background checks or verify the identity of our Users. But we may do so as part of our fraud detection and prevention process.</li>
<li>We do not guarantee anything about the Services, including the actions of our Users. We do not guarantee matches, the frequency of your matches, that you will be compatible with those you match with, or that the people you match with are safe people to meet. You must exercise your own diligence and caution in using the Services and communicating with its Users.</li>
<li>You have a right in some states to cancel this Agreement within 3 business days of registering for a premium account and receive a refund of any payments to us if you do so. Please see Section 20for more details.</li>
<li>Lastly, by using the Services, you are agreeing (with limited exception) to resolve any dispute between you and us through binding, individual arbitration, rather than in court. Please review Section 19below for details, including the procedure for opting out of arbitration.</li>
</ul>
<h5>2. Eligibility</h5>
<ul>
<li><em><u>You must be at least 18, or older if your jurisdiction requires</u>.</em>You must be at least 18 years old (or, if the age of majority is higher than 18 in your jurisdiction, then the age of majority in your jurisdiction) create an Account and use the Services. By creating an Account and/or using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old (or the minimum age of majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is greater).</li>
<li><em><u>You must be unattached and available</u>.</em>You may only use the Services if you are willing and capable of entering into a new romantic relationship and do not have an established monogamous romantic partner (“Unattached”).</li>
<li><em><u>You may not have a criminal record</u>.</em>You may not use the Services if you have been convicted of a felony, are required to register as a sex offender with any government entity, and/or are identified as a “Specially Designated National” (as such list may be updated from time to time, available at <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx">https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx</a>). If any of the foregoing become applicable to you after you have created an Account, you must delete your Account immediately and you may no longer use the Services. We do not conduct criminal background screenings on Users. However, we reserve the right to conduct any criminal background check, at any time and using available public records, to confirm your compliance with this subsection.</li>
</ul>
<h5>3. Use of the Service</h5>
<ul>
<li><em><u>Creating an Account on Coffee Meets Bagel</u>. </em>In order to use Coffee Meets Bagel, you must create an account with us (an “Account”) by first logging in with your Facebook account or by providing your phone number. If you choose to create an Account by logging in with Facebook, you authorize us to access and use certain Facebook account information, including but not limited to your public Facebook profile photographs, personal information, and Facebook friends (to display common friends with other Users). For more information regarding the information we collect from you and how we use it, please consult our Privacy Policy.</li>
<li><em><u>Your Account is only for you</u>. </em>You may only access and use your Account in accordance with this Agreement and for your personal use to find and communicate with potential dating partners. You may not authorize others to access or use your Account, and you may not assign or otherwise transfer your Account to any other person or entity. You acknowledge that we are not responsible from any third party access to your Account, particularly any such access that results from theft or misappropriation of your Account or Facebook account’s login credentials. You agree to immediately notify Coffee Meets Bagel of any disclosure or unauthorized use of your login credentials at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1c7f7372687d7f685c7f737a7a7979717979686f7e7d7b7970327f7371"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b1d2dedfc5d0d2c5f1d2ded7d7d4d4dcd4d4c5c2d3d0d6d4dd9fd2dedc">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</li>
<li><em><u>Accessing the Services from outside the United States</u>. </em>Using the Service may be prohibited or restricted in certain countries. If you use the Service from outside of the United States, you are fully responsible for complying with the laws and regulations of the territory from which you access or use the Services.</li>
<li><em><u>You are responsible for any content you submit</u>. </em>You are solely responsible for, and assume all liability regarding, any information and content you provide or otherwise make available on the Services, including without limitation text, images and video in your profile and in your communications with other Users (“User Content”).</li>
<li><em><u>No contact information in your profile</u></em>. You agree not to post any contact information such as your phone number and email address in the body of your profile.</li>
</ul>
<h5>4. Changes to Agreement or Services</h5>
<p>We may update this Agreement at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we’ll let you know either by posting the updated Agreement on the Site and App or through other communications. It’s important that you review the Agreement whenever we update them or you use the Services. If you continue to use the Services after we have posted an updated Agreement, you are agreeing to be bound by the updated Agreement. If you don’t agree to be bound by the updated Agreement, then, except as otherwise provided in Section 19(f)“Effect of Changes on Arbitration,” you may not use the Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.</p>

If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.</li>
<li><u>Class Action Waiver</u>.  YOU AND COFFEE MEETS BAGEL AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person&#8217;s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.</li>

<h5>Information we collect and how we collect it:</h5>
<p>Information collected automatically:</p>

This information includes:<br />
– Mobile Device ID. Your mobile device’s unique ID number (e.g., IMEI, AD ID).<br />
– Geolocation. With your permission, your mobile device’s geographic location (GPS) when you first register for Coffee Meets Bagel through our mobile app or when you enable location services within the app.<br />
– Device Information/Specifications. Technical information about your computer or mobile device (e.g., type of device, web browser or operating system, IP address) to analyze trends, administer the site, prevent fraud, track visitor movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information.<br />
– Usage Information. How long and in what manner you use Coffee Meets Bagel, which services and features you use and any content that you generate through and post on Coffee Meets Bagel.  This includes browsing and search history (including profiles you have viewed). We link your subscriber information with your activity on Coffee Meets Bagel across all your devices using your email, phone number or similar information.<br />
– Cookies: We and our service providers and business partners use “cookies” to keep track of some types of information while you are visiting Coffee Meets Bagel or using our services. “Cookies” are very small files placed on your computer, and they allow us to count the number of visitors to our Website and distinguish repeat visitors from new visitors. They also allow us and third parties we work with to save user preferences, track user trends, and advertise to you. We use both session and persistent cookies on our Website; session cookies expire at the end of a particular visit to our Website, while persistent cookies (also called stored cookies) remain active until you disable them through your browser settings, or until a pre-set expiration date. We rely on cookies for the proper operation of Coffee Meets Bagel; therefore if your browser is set to reject all cookies, Coffee Meets Bagel may not function properly. Without this information, we will not be able to provide you with all of the requested services, and any differences in services are related to your information.</p>
<p>– Web Beacons: “Web beacons” (also known as “clear gifs” and “pixel tags”) are small transparent graphic images that are often used in conjunction with cookies in order to further personalize Coffee Meets Bagel for our users, collect a limited set of information about our visitors, and advertise to our users. We may also use web beacons in email communications in order to understand the behavior of our customers, such as whether an email has been opened or acted upon.</p>

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.</p>

<p>Your Choices</p>
<p>Cookies. You may be able to refuse or disable cookies by adjusting your browser settings. Because each browser is different, please consult the instructions provided by your browser.

Without this information, we are not able to provide you with all the requested services, and any differences in services are related to your information.</p>
<p>You can manage third-party advertising preferences for some of the third parties we work with to serve advertising across the Internet by clicking here and by utilizing the choices available at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a> and <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.</p>
<p>SMS Messages.  You may opt out of receiving SMS messages from us by following the instructions in the SMS message or by otherwise contacting us.</p>

We currently do not take action in response to these signals.</p>
