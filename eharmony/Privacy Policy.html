<U>Collection, processing and use of personal data</U></p>
<p class="ps_standardText">Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (e.g., name, address, phone number, date of birth or e-mail address). When we say that we process personal data, this means that we collect, store, use, transfer to others or delete such data.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">eharmony collects and processes your personal data exclusively in the following cases:
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
<ul>
<li>If you visit us on our website without being a member.</li>
<li>If you contact us directly.</li>
<li>If you install our eharmony app.</li>
<li>If you subscribe to an eharmony membership (paid or free) and then use eharmony.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">Once you have signed up for an eharmony account, we will provide you with access to an online database over which you will be able to get know other eharmony-registered customers (also known as members). In order to provide you with the eharmony service as described in the General Terms and Conditions (the “eharmony Service” or “Service”), we need to use your personal data. If you do not want us to use your personal data or parts thereof, we will not be able to provide you with the Service. You will also need to provide us with special categories of personal data (i.e. sensitive personal data, such as information about your sexual orientation). Please see below for further information about the types of personal data eharmony collects when you use our Service.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText" style="font-weight:bold" id="pp09"><b>Data processing through app stores</b>
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">Before you can install our app, you may have to enter into a user agreement with an app store operator (e.g. Google or Apple). Our app is available on different app platforms, depending on your particular operating system.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">In order to install and use our app via these app stores, you will need to have a valid account with the app store operator as well as a compatible device (e.g. a smartphone). eharmony has no control over the collection, processing and use of personal data in this respect. The relevant app store operator will be the sole data controller of this information. If necessary, please contact the operator of the respective app store directly for information about their data processing. eharmony is the data controller with respect to your personal data only when you use the eharmony app.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText"><b>What personal data does eharmony collect from its members to fulfil the contractual relationship?</b>
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">In order to register for the eharmony Service and conclude a Basic Membership or a Premium Membership, you will need to provide us with the personal data described below. In addition, in order to provide you with our Services (as more fully described in the <a href="https://www.eharmony.co.uk/termsandconditions/"target="_blank">General Terms and Conditions</a>), we need to process this personal data.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText"><b>Registration process</b>
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">In order to register for eharmony’s free Service (i.e.,conclude a “Basic Membership”), you will need to provide us with personal data, without which the registration cannot be completed. These data are:
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
<ul>
<li>Gender and sex of partner sought (your sexual preference is data regarding your sexual orientation and therefore sensitive personal data)</li>
<li>Email address </li>
<li>Password </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">If you have chosen to log in via a third-party provider such as Facebook or Apple, you do not need to enter an email address or a password during the registration process. You can access eharmony’s Service respectively with the email address and the password you have indicated (your access data) or alternatively via the third party provider’s login data.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText"><b>During registration via Apple ("Sign in with Apple")</b>
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">You can register to join the eharmony Service using your Apple-ID. If you choose to do this, we will receive the information that we need for your registration directly from Apple. In this respect, a data transfer takes place. Apple enables you to share the email address associated with your Apple account with eharmony or hide it. If you hide your email address, we will receive a randomly generated unique email address from Apple for the creation and use of your eharmony account. Our communications will be sent to this email address and automatically forwarded by Apple to your email address, if you have not deactivated forwarding of eharmony emails.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">Please be aware that we have no control over the type and amount of information that Apple collects about you when you register for our Service using the Apple login. If you do not want Apple to collect information about you in relation to your use of our Service, you should not use the Apple login.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">You may dissociate your eharmony account from your Apple-ID at any time in your profile on our website. In this case, we will need your access data, as mentioned above.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">For more information about the types of information collected by Apple and how Apple uses your information, as well as about your rights and your ability to protect your data, please see <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/" target="_blank">Apple’s Privacy Policy</a>.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText"><b>During registration via Facebook ("Facebook Login")</b>
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">eharmony uses the “Register with Facebook” business tool with the add-on “Data Access Function,“ through which you can register to join the eharmony Service using your Facebook account. If you choose to do this, we will receive the following authentication data for your registration directly from Facebook: the email address that is associated with your Facebook account, your profile name and your profile picture, of which eharmony only stores and processes the email address. In this respect, a data transfer takes place. Your Facebook profile name and profile picture are not stored or processed by us but are automatically deleted.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">If you use the Facebook login on our website or app, Facebook will also collect data through third-party scripts, process this data for the purpose of Facebook Analytics or forward it to third parties. The Facebook privacy policy explains which data may be collected through the Facebook login. This includes data about your device, your use of eharmony, the websites that you have visited, as well as adverts that you have viewed. Unfortunately, it is technically impossible for us to prevent this processing by Facebook. If you do not want Facebook to collect information about you in relation to your use of our Service, you should not use the Facebook login and/or adjust your tracking parameters directly in your Facebook account before accessing or using eharmony.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">You may dissociate your eharmony account from your Facebook-ID at any time in your profile on our website. In this case, we will need your access data, as explained above.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">For more information about the types of information collected by Facebook and how Facebook will use your information, as well as about your rights and your ability to protect your data), please see <a href="file:///C:/Users/cdauvergne/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/X30DJZTO/Facebook’s%20privacy%20policy" target="_blank">Facebook’s privacy policy</a>.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText"><b>Data required in connexion with a Basic Membership</b>
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">Our Service works by providing your profile information (“profile”) and your compatibility scores to other eharmony users. In order to get the full benefit of our Service and to set up your eharmony profile, we will ask you to provide us with data about yourself. This may include information about your personal values and preferences, your appearance, and any other characteristics that are relevant for us to establish your personality profile and to recommend potential partners (“matches”) to you. When designing your profile, you will also need to provide us with information about yourself, including text and photos. In addition, we also collect information about you when you provide your answers to the eharmony test (“compatibility quiz”) and we will use this information to automatically create your eharmony personality evaluation (“personality profile”). Please note that, although you will be able to read your personality profile and compatibility scores in your profile, your personality profile is not generally publicly visible to other eharmony members. Instead, those members who directly access your profile information will only have access to extracts of your personality profile and your compatibility points.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">When we ask you to provide us with information about you during the registration process, we make it clear when such information will be kept private and will not be made available to other users. Please note that your specific answers to eharmony’s compatibility quiz are generally kept private, however, the compatibility scores that we generate from your answers are made publicly available to other members. Additionally, the information you voluntarily provide for hobbies and interests within the quiz will be visible to your matches in your profile, but you may update or delete this information at any time. All other information you provide us with for or as part of your eharmony profile will be publicly visible to other members on our website and our app, such as information that you voluntarily choose to include in your profile, especially your first name, place of residence / postal code, and your interests.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">We will not be able to suggest matches for you if you do not provide us with the requested information relating to your sexual preferences (i.e. both preferred sex and gender), or the other information requested as part of the eharmony compatibility quiz. If you do not want to provide us with this information, you will not be able to use our Service.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">Generally, the types of data that we will collect during the registration are as follows:
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
<ul>
<li>Residence/postal code</li>
<li>Country of residence</li>
<li>Date of birth</li>
<li>Full name</li>
<li>Height</li>
<li>Number of children</li>
<li>Marital status</li>
<li>Education level</li>
<li>Occupation</li>
<li>Income</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">In addition, you may choose to provide us with sensitive information such as:
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText"><ul>
<li>Religion</li>
<li>Ethnicity</li>
<li>Political view.</li>
</ul></p>
<p class="ps_standardText">By giving us this information, you agree that we store and use this information for matching purposes. This information allows us to further refine the match preferences and search criteria available to you when searching for a partner on our platform. This information will be disclosed in your profile, and therefore, visible to matches who visit your profile. However, please note that you do not have to provide us with this information in order to use the eharmony Service, and you may change your answers to “prefer not to specify” in the religion, ethnicity and/or political view fields at any time in your profile.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">You may also upload photos of yourself in your profile, whereby other members may see, next to your first name, your photos clearly (i.e. unblurred version) in your profile or in a blurred version via email. Please note that you do not have to upload any photos in order to use the eharmony Service. You may upload photos to your profile at any time, even after you completed your registration or already used the Service for a period of time.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">You do not have to provide us with your mobile phone number in order to use the eharmony Service. However, if you want to, you can provide it to us for an additional security measure (known as “SMS verification”). This functionality is available to all our members but only after logging in to our eharmony Service. This will allow us to carry out a further identification check to make sure that you are the right person to be using your profile – please see more on this below.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText"><b>Upon Completion of a Premium Membership</b>
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">If you decide to sign up for eharmony’s Premium chargeable features (“Premium Membership”) via the website (i.e. you decide to become a Premium member), we will collect your payment data during your order. However, please note that your credit card data is not stored by us, but is instead stored by a third party payment provider.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">If you purchase a Premium Membership via an app store provider (e.g. Google or Apple), please refer to the terms of use of the relevant app platform operator to find out which personal data they process in relation to the purchase process. eharmony does not process any payment or billing data in this respect.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText"><b>Communication with members, communication with our customer care and communication via video chat</b>
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">If you correspond with other eharmony members through the eharmony platform, or with eharmony customer care, we will collect and store this information. The messages sent between members via our Service are end-to-end encrypted.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">If you contact our customer care, please note the following: if you communicate with our customer care:
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
<ol>
<li>using the online contact form: the content of your message to us will be encrypted in transit; our reply will be protected in transit, provided that your email provider supports Transport Layer Security (TLS) transfer encryption.</li>
<li>via email: the content of your message to us will only be protected in transit via TLS transfer encryption if your email provider supports TLS transport encryption.</li>
<li>(if available) via chat function for logged-in members in the customer service portal, the transmission of chat communication is SSL-encrypted (transport encryption). If the chat function is used with customer service, an appropriate chat report will be provided.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">Please note that, in principle, communications between you and eharmony will only be conducted via the email address associated with your eharmony account. Members who are registered via Apple and have hidden their email address will only receive communications if the automatic forwarding function is activated through Apple. Please bear in mind that Apple does not inform us whether you have activated the forwarding function.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">If you would prefer not to contact our customer care by email (for example, because you are concerned that your email provider does not support TLS encryption or the content of our email is not encrypted), please contact eharmony by post or fax instead. You will find our contact details under <a href="#pp07" target="_blank">Contact</a>
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">As a Premium Member, as well as in some promotions for Basic Members, you have the opportunity to communicate with other members via video chat in selected countries. For this purpose, eharmony uses a service provider based in the USA with whom eharmony has a data processing agreement. Standard contractual clauses are integrated in this agreement and the use of additional technical and organisational security measures is contractually guaranteed. eharmony transfers your IP address and your profile ID to this service provider when using the video chat feature. The service provider also stores data regarding the time and duration of any video chat calls. This data processing is necessary technically and for billing purposes. The video communication is encrypted end-to-end. Video and audio content is not stored. eharmony does not collect or transfer any other data in connection with video chat. If you do not want eharmony to transfer your IP address and your profile ID to its service provider, or do not want the time and duration of the chat to be stored, you should not use the video chat function.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText"><b>Promotional emails - Messages</b>

</p>
<p class="ps_standardText"><b>What information does eharmony process when you use the eharmony platform?</b>
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">Part of our Service is providing you with potential partners (“matches”). These matches are presented to you in your profile and via notifications (e.g. emails), with the following information: first name, age, place of residence or postal code, a photo, compatibility score and a link to their profile. Please note that we may present you at any time as a match to other members, including those based outside the UK and/or using one of our other eharmony platforms. As such, your first name, age, place of residence or postal code, photo, compatibility score and a link to your profile will be provided to these members. In general, Basic Members will see only your photos blurred, but may be able, in some instances, to see your photos clearly. Premium Members will see your photos clearly.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">In your profile, under “Notification options”, you may choose to receive notifications from us (e.g., emails or push messages) to alert you when there has been activity in your account (e.g. you have received a new message or we have new matches for you). Please note that if you do not choose this notification option, your matches who have requested notifications may still receive notifications related to you (e.g., when you send them a new message or we send your profile as a suggested new match). As such, and as mentioned above, your first name, place of residence or postal code, photo, age, compatibility score and a link to your profile may appear in such notifications.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">You may also request to be informed about: (1) which matches visited your profile (“visitors of my profile”) and/or (2) if your matches are currently online (green circle if they are online, or grey circle if they are not). Please note that if you do so, the same information regarding your activity will be available to your matches who have also selected these notification options. As such, and subject to a match’s notification settings, (1) a match whose profile you visited may be informed of your visit, and (2) your matches may be notified when you are online or offline.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">In addition, you are able to see the last time a match was online (“last time online”), and your matches are also able to see when you last logged in. This feature is set up automatically and, for technical reasons, cannot be deactivated.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText"><b>Success stories</b>

<p class="ps_standardText">

This information is stored in a database and compared against empirical values and information. If our automated processing activities suggest that our Service has been misused, an eharmony employee will review the relevant rating and underlying clues, as well as the information in your profile (including any wording and photos you have provided) to confirm whether this is the case. In addition, Customer care representatives perform profile checks to check members’ profiles that have been reported by other members through the function “suspicious profile?” or as having breached our General Terms and Conditions. Furthermore, as mentioned above, if you have provided your mobile phone number, eharmony may use this information to carry out an identity check (SMS verification),(i.e. to check that you are who you say you are). (The legal basis for these activities is the legitimate interests of eharmony and our eharmony members, to ensure that the eharmony Service is not used in a way that is in breach of our General Terms and Conditions and/or the law.

In the event of payment disputes, we also transfer data as necessary and appropriate for the purpose of asserting our rights (e.g. in the case of disputed payment obligations, requests from banks, or within the framework of conflict resolution for chargebacks).

<U>Rights of the data subject at a glance</U></p>
<p class="ps_standardText">Under the UK GDPR and data protection laws, you have rights, including:
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText"><b>Your right to be informed</b> – You have a right to receive concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible information about your personal data and our use of it.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText"><b>Your right of access</b> – You have the right to ask us for copies of your personal data. This right always applies. There are some exemptions, which means you may not always receive all the information. When you request this data, this is known as making a data subject access request (DSAR).
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText"><b>Your right to rectification</b> – You have the right to ask us to rectify personal data you think is inaccurate. You also have the right to ask us to complete information you think is incomplete. This right always applies.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText"><b>Your right to erasure</b> - You have the right to ask us to erase your personal data in certain circumstances. We have the right to refuse to comply with a request for erasure if we are processing the personal data for one of the following reasons:
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
<ul>
<li>To exercise the right of freedom of expression and information.</li>
<li>To comply with a legal obligation.</li>
<li>To perform a task in the public interest or exercise official authority.</li>
<li>For archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific research, historical research or statistical purposes.</li>
<li>For the exercise or defence of legal claims.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText"><b>Your right to restriction of processing</b> – You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances. In such case, we will still hold the data but will not process it any further. This right is an alternative to the right to erasure. If one of the following conditions applies, you may exercise the right to restrict processing:
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
<ul>
<li>The accuracy of the personal data is contested.</li>
<li>Processing of the personal data is unlawful.</li>
<li>We no longer need the personal data for processing, but the personal data is required for part of a legal process.</li>
<li>The right to object has been exercised and processing is restricted pending a decision on the status of the processing.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText"><b>Your right to object to processing</b> – You have the right to object to processing in certain circumstances. You can also object if the processing is for a task carried out in the public interest, the exercise of official authority vested in you, or your legitimate interests (or those of a third party).
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText"><b>Your right to data portability</b> – This right only applies if we are processing information based on your consent or for the performance of a contract and the processing is automated.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">If you would like to exercise any of your rights, please use the information under <a href="#pp07" target="_blank">Contact</a>. Please also ensure that when you do so, we will be able to clearly identify you.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">Alternatively, you may use the setting options in your eharmony profile to rectify certain information that you provided during your registration or to object to advertising.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">You can also delete your data or your complete profile from an eharmony Basic Membership yourself in your profile (if you have completed the eharmony compatibility quiz). To do this, log in to your profile on the eharmony website and delete your profile under <a href="https://eharmony.co.uk/settings/dataandsettings" target="_blank">Data & Settings / Profile</a>. Alternatively, Basic Members can contact our customer service using the information under <a href="#pp07" target="_blank">Contact</a> and request the deletion of their data. However, please note that Premium Members can only delete data regarding their Premium Membership by contacting our customer care.
</p>

</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">You have the right to file a complaint with a data protection authority. If you are located in the UK, you can contact the UK’s data protection authority, the Information Commissioner’s Office, at: Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire, SK9 5AF, Telephone Number: + 44 (0) 303 123 1113, Email: <a href="mailto:casework@ico.org.uk">casework@ico.org.uk</a>.
