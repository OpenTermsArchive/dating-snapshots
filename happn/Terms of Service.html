<h1>Definitions</h1>
<p>In these Terms of Service, the following terms are employed with the meanings set out below: </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Application</strong>: The HAPPN application, available on the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store and on the HAPPN Webapp : <a href="https://app.happn.com/">https://app.happn.com</a></p>
<p><strong>HAPPN</strong>: HAPPN, a French joint stock company (Société par Actions Simplifiée) with paid-in capital of €36,982.92 registered with the Paris RCS (trade and companies registry) under no. 535 217 723, and owner and sole operator of the HAPPN application and trademark.</p>
<p><strong>TOS</strong>: These Terms of Service.</p>
<p><strong>Member</strong>: A person registered with the Application. Members include Subscribers.</p>
<p><strong>Member Characteristics</strong>: Information provided by the Member describing his or her lifestyle and personal characteristics on the profile. The Member can choose the information he or she wishes to appear on the profile and filter other Members on the Application based on this information.</p>
<p><strong>Map (Mapping)</strong>: A map that allows you to find Members with whom you’ve crossed paths.</p>
<p><strong>Pass (represented by a Cross)</strong>: An action represented by a cross, expressing a lack of interest. This function is confidential and no notification is sent. “Passed” profiles will not appear on the Member’s timeline in the future, but could however be found again on the Map.</p>
<p><strong>Like</strong>: An action represented by a heart, expressing interest. Subscribers Members have access to the list of Likes. Except for the first Like, this function remains hidden from non-Premium Members until they receive a reciprocal Like.</p>
<p><strong>SuperCrush</strong> : a function that sends a notification to the Member to whom you address it, and which also enables you to send him or her a private, personalized message to start a private conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Profile Certification</strong>: a function that enables the authentication of a Member’s Profile picture(s) to obtain the “Certified Profile” badge, which enables other Members to see that the photo of the Member’s face posted on his or her profile corresponds to his or her real visual identity while moving (via the video).</p>
<p><strong>Crush</strong>: An event that is created between two profiles, triggered by a Like on both profiles. It represents mutual interest and sends out a “You have a Crush” notification, allowing Members to start a conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Boost</strong>: a function enabling Members to increase the visibility of their profile during the time that this option is activated. </p>
<p><strong>Messages and/or voice messages</strong>: Only Members who have a Crush (or a FlashNote, if eligible) can use the Application’s “Chat” function to send each other Messages. Messages are stored in the inbox, which is accessible via the icon on the top right of the homepage.</p>
<p><strong>Packs</strong>: Bundles of Charged Services purchased by Members.</p>
<p><strong>Profile Photos</strong>: photos on your profile enabling the easy identification of the Member. The Member accepts to, at the very least, provide a photo of his or her face in which he or she is clearly recognizable, and place it in first position. These two criteria combined are an essential condition for using the Services.</p>
<p>If the photo of the Member’s face is not placed in first position, it will be automatically placed in first position by default. If the Member has several photos of his or her face, he or she will be able to choose their order of appearance.</p>
<p><strong>Services</strong>: All services, whether charged or free-of-charge, offered by HAPPN to encourage virtual or real-life meet-ups between Members who have crossed paths and who have a mutual interest in one another, according to the selected search criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Shortlist</strong>: A free feature enabling Members to access a selection of three profiles recommended by HAPPN every day. The Shortlist feature is available from Members’ third day of activity on their profiles.</p>
<p><strong>HAPPN Premium</strong>: All charged Services offered by HAPPN in the form of a subscription whose duration is chosen by the Member. </p>
<p><strong>HAPPN Supreme:</strong> a subscription-based set of paid Services offered by HAPPN allowing the Member to choose the duration.</p>
<p><strong>Subscriber Member</strong>: member who has subscribed to HAPPN Premium or HAPPN Supreme.</p>
<p><strong>Account</strong>: The Member’s dedicated personal area within the Application, which he or she accesses when he or she registers and connects to the Application. It enables the Member to access the Services. A Member may only have one Account.</p>
<p><strong>CrushTime</strong>: An optional game, offered by HAPPN via a notification to the Member. For each hand, guess which person Liked you from a board of four profiles by sending him or her a Like in return.</p>
<h1>Article 1: Scope </h1>
<p> </p>
<p>The TOS define the rights and obligations of the parties when using the Application. They form the basis of the contractual relationship between the Member and HAPPN.</p>
<h2>1.1 Conflicting Rules</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>These Terms of Service (TOS) determine the main rules of use for the Application. They are supplemented by additional policies – the <a href="http://www.happn.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, the <a href="http://www.happn.com/cookies">Cookies Use Policy</a> and the <a href="http://www.happn.com/trust">Confidence Charter</a> – in order to provide the Member with clearer guidance on how to use the Application. In the event of a conflict between the various policies making the rules inaccessible, unintelligible and/or unpredictable, these TOS shall prevail over the Privacy Policy, the Cookies Use Policy and the Confidence Charter.  </p>
<h2>1.2 Independence of Provisions</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Should any provision of these TOS be declared invalid or inapplicable due to the effects of a law, regulation or ruling by a court with relevant jurisdiction, the other provisions shall remain effective and in force, unless these TOS become distorted, or the obligations of the parties significantly thrown out of balance. </p>
<h1>Article 2: Amendments to the TOS</h1>
<h2>2.1 Updates</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>HAPPN reserves the right, unilaterally and at any time, to add to or amend these TOS as it sees fit or to terminate the Services. </p>
<p>The Member will be informed of updates to the TOS via the Application and/or by email sent to the address provided by the Member. It is the Member’s responsibility to ensure that this email address is valid.</p>
<p>It is the Member’s responsibility to carefully read the updated TOS and to be fully aware of any changes ensuing from said updates.</p>
<p>Complete acceptance of the changes is implied by the Member’s continued use of the Application’s Services following the updates.</p>
<p>Should the Member not agree with changes made to the TOS, he or she has the option to end the Services and delete his or her Account as per Article 14.3.</p>
<h2>2.2 Immediate Effect</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>All new versions of the TOS shall be effective immediately for all Members.</p>
<h1>Article 3: Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h1>
<h2>3.1 Governing Law</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>These TOS shall be governed by French law, exclusive of its conflict of laws rules.  </p>
<h2>3.2 Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>In the case of dispute, the Member agrees to contact HAPPN directly in writing (by email or letter, to the email or postal address provided in article 15 hereof) prior to taking any judicial or extra-judicial action, in order to try and find an amicable settlement to this dispute.</p>
<p>In the case of failure, the Member is informed that he or she may choose to have recourse to mediation, free of charge, and submit its dispute to the Online Dispute Resolution platform proposed by the European Commission, which may be accessed at the following address: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/">http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/</a>.</p>
<p>Any challenge or dispute related to the formation, interpretation, performance or expiry of these TOS or in any connection therewith which has not been amicably settled shall be submitted to the relevant courts of Paris (France).</p>
<h1>Article 4: Registration</h1>
<h2>4.1 Application Download Options</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The Application is available on the Apple and Google official download platforms and via la HAPPN Webapp, which is free to access at this address: <a href="https://app.happn.com/">https://app.happn.com</a> . It can be downloaded free-of-charge from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, on iPhones running version iOS 10 or higher, and Android Smartphones running version 5 or higher.</p>
<h2>4.2 Member’s Rights when Registering</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Provided that the required conditions for Member status are met, HAPPN shall assign the Member a personal Account, which includes:</p>
<p>•    A profile page </p>
<p>•    An inbox</p>
<p>•    A “notifications” option</p>
<p>A Member may only have one Account.</p>
<h2>4.3 Obligations of the Member when Registering</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The Member must be over the age of 18, and must guarantee that all information provided when registering is true and up-to-date. </p>
<p>Registration can be done in these ways:</p>
<p>- via a mobile phone number: in this case, no information on the Member may be automatically retrieved and it is his or her responsibility to supply personal information such as first and last name, sex, date of birth as well as other additional information if desired and one or more personal photos at the time of registration. </p>
<p>- Via Apple or Google Sign in: it is the Member’s responsibility to provide information relating to him or her, such as first name, last name, gender, date of birth, and other additional information if he or she wishes. The Member must also provide one or more photos of himself or herself when registering.</p>
<p>- Via the HAPPN Webapp via a mobile phone number or Google Sign in.</p>
<p>Upon registration, the Member accepts these TOS and the Privacy Policy and agrees to fulfill his or her obligations, and particularly those set out in the Member Code of Conduct defined in Article 8 of these TOS.</p>
<h1>Article 5: Services and Features</h1>
<h2>5.1 Purpose of the Service</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>HAPPN is an online dating application enabling Members to find, in the Application, people with whom they have crossed paths or may cross paths, as well as those likely to interest them. The Application offers Members profiles that are automatically selected using artificial intelligence systems (« AIS ») based on their search preferences, their profile activity on the Application, their Characteristics, favourite places or location. HAPPN undertakes to implement these AIS in accordance with the “AI Systems” article of these T&amp;Cs. The Member cannot modify the recommendation criteria. We believe these criteria are the most likely to determine your compatibility with the profiles offered by the Application. However, the information that the Member fills in on his/her profile is likely to influence the recommendations.</p>
<p>Each Member is free to talk to and form relationships with other Members in compliance with these TOS and the law.</p>
<p>The Services offered by HAPPN may in no case be likened to a counseling or marriage bureau service. Its sole aim is to facilitate virtual or real-life meet-ups through the Application between Members with mutual interests, according to their locations and preferences.</p>
<h2>5.2 Services for Members</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Some of HAPPN’s services are available on the Application free of charge (apart from connection and telecommunications costs) for Members who agree to comply with these TOS, including:</p>
<p>• Sending a limited number of Likes.</p>
<p>• Sending of Messages and voice messages when one has a Crush.</p>
<p>• Viewing of other Members’ profiles.</p>
<p>• Passing a number of profiles.</p>
<p>• Playing CrushTime.</p>
<p>• Confidentially blocking all Members whose conduct justifies such an action.</p>
<p>• Confidentially reporting all Members whose conduct is contrary to the TOS or applicable law.</p>
<p>• Locating the points at which you’ve crossed paths with Members.</p>
<p>• Accessing the list of Members with whom he or she has crossed paths.</p>
<p>• Accessing suggested profiles.</p>
<p>• Configuring his or her search criteria.</p>
<p>• Receiving notifications.</p>
<p>• Consulting the FAQ and Tutorials.</p>
<p>• Finding out how many SuperCrushs and Crushes he or she has received without these figures being visible to other Members.</p>
<p>• Completing his or her profile in compliance with the TOS.</p>
<p>• Deleting Messages.</p>
<p>Charged services provided via the Application are available to Members after purchasing a Pack or a HAPPN subscription, the conditions of which are set out in article 9.</p>
<h1>Article 6: Protection of Personal Data</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>HAPPN is very concerned with the protection of your personal data and the respect of your privacy. We suggest that you read our Privacy Policy and our Confidence Charter carefully to better understand how we process your personal data, available by clicking on the following links: </p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.happn.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.happn.com/trust">Confidence Charter</a></p>
<h1>Article 7: HAPPN’s Obligations and Liability</h1>
<h2>7.1 Technical Resources and Security</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>HAPPN agrees to provide the infrastructure and technical resources to provide a high-quality service to Members with an iPhone device running operating system version iOS 10 or higher, an Android Smartphone running version 5 or higher.</p>
<p>HAPPN cannot be held liable for any operating fault on the Member’s device or for any compatibility issue between the Application and the device.</p>
<p>In addition, every effort is made to ensure that the risks of fraudulent access to HAPPN’s system are minimized.  In this respect, HAPPN uses a firewall or equipment located between the Internet and the company’s private network, in order to make its security more robust by filtering traffic to and from the internet. It is, however, impossible to fully guarantee the security of a network. </p>
<p>HAPPN is not responsible for any failures, interruptions or poor performance of the Member’s internet provider Services, or for any cause beyond HAPPN’s control which might interrupt or have an adverse effect on access to HAPPN Services.</p>
<p>The Member must have access to a secure email account. If such a precaution is not taken, or even if it is, while this probability remains low, the Member’s Account may be vulnerable to fraud. </p>
<p>HAPPN shall also endeavor to avert Members of any exceptional risk of receiving spam Messages or Messages claiming to have been sent by HAPPN. The Member must be attentive and vigilant in order to avoid being the victim of scams and report any of the above circumstances to HAPPN by sending a letter or email to the address provided in Article 15 hereof.</p>
<h2>7.2 Illegal Conduct  </h2>
<p> </p>
<p>HAPPN and its partners cannot be held liable for actions by its Members which are illegal or which incur criminal penalties, including but not limited to:</p>
<p>• All types of scams, </p>
<p>• All activities of a commercial or professional nature,</p>
<p>• Prostitution,</p>
<p>• Identity theft,</p>
<p>• An infringement of a third-party intellectual property right,</p>
<p>• An infringement of personal rights, such as image rights and the respect of the right to privacy. </p>
<p>• Any such behaviour may result in the suspension or termination of these terms and conditions of use in accordance with Article 15.4 herein.</p>
<h2>7.3 Reporting and Community Moderation System</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>HAPPN, as host, is not bound by any general obligation to monitor the content transmitted or stored via the Application pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 of 19 October 2022 on a single market for digital services (‘Digital Services Regulation’).</p>
<p>However, in accordance with Article 16 of the Digital Services Regulation, HAPPN shall set up a notification system to report illegal, abusive and harmful content.</p>
<p>In this case, after verification by Customer Services, HAPPN undertakes to promptly remove the manifestly illegal content.</p>
<p>In addition, the Application allows Members to report content if it constitutes apology for crimes against humanity, apology for and incitement to terrorism, incitement to racial hatred, incitement to hatred based on gender, sexual orientation or handicap and inter alia child pornography, incitement to violence against women and violation of human dignity.</p>
<p>Guided by an extremely strict professional ethic and refusing any association with violent or insulting Members as well as unlawful, abusive or prejudicial content, HAPPN’s team takes this reporting procedure very seriously, which may also be implemented in the case of statements contrary to accepted social etiquette.</p>
<p>Hence, when the content published by a Member is reported, the transmitter’s account can be suspended or terminated according to the conditions set forth in Article 14.4. This decision is based on the proof given by the report’s author and is made in order to ensure the withdrawal of the content in compliance with HAPPN’s legal obligations.</p>
<p>The Member having originally published the reported content will in no case be informed of the identity of the report’s author.</p>
<p>Outside the scope of this reporting system, the Member can decide to block another Member whose conduct does not comply with the rules of etiquette in order to prevent any conversation with him or her (mutual prevention of access to Likes, SuperCrushs, Messages and voice messages that have been sent in the past and of sending any messages in the future, or being alerted of the presence of a Member who has been blocked, particularly if they think this Member is bothering them in one way or another).  This action is confidential and enables Members to control the Members with whom they want to keep in touch or not.  </p>
<p>This reporting system is accessible and operational: </p>
<p>• On iPhone: At the bottom of the Member's profile and at the top right corner of the conversation with the Member concerned.</p>
<p>• On Android smartphones: At the bottom of the Member's profile and at the top right corner of the conversation with the Member concerned.</p>
<p>Should content be published that was reported and that may be seen as a violation of law or regulations, the Member who is a victim of this content is encouraged to submit a complaint to the appropriate police authorities.</p>
<p>The reporting system put in place by HAPPN does not replace any complaint and judicial procedure against a Member who authored the reported content. </p>
<p>Any misuse of the community moderation system or any unjustified reporting of a Member (manifestly unfounded reports made in bad faith) shall be considered a breach of these TOS, and penalties may be imposed including Account suspension/termination, pursuant to Article 14.4 « Suspension/Termination of the Account by HAPPN in the event that a Member violates the terms and conditions of use » of the TOS, besides application of penalties pursuant to Article 6.I-4 of the French Trust in the Digital Economy Act or even legal proceedings, under which damages may have to be paid to victims.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition, in accordance with its Privacy Policy, HAPPN puts measures in place to support its Members' peace of mind and security on the Application. </p>
<h2>7.4 Duty of Caution</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The Member is solely liable for checking the identity of the people with whom he or she wishes to arrange a “real-life” meet-up. HAPPN may not be held liable for any problems whatsoever arising from a “real-life” meet-up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Similarly, the Member is solely liable for checking the identity of the Crush with whom they may want to engage in a Video Call and organize a “virtual” meetup. HAPPN may not be held liable for any incidents occurring during a “virtual” meetup.</p>
<h2>7.5 Group Events</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Any use of HAPPN Services to organize a group meeting of its Members constitutes a misuse of the Service. This is why using the Application to plan or organize a demonstration in a public place is strictly prohibited. Should such a meeting take place, HAPPN may not be held liable in the case of a public order offense or any damage caused by such meeting.</p>
<h2><br />7.6 AI Systems</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>HAPPN uses AI systems to:</p>
<p>- detect fake profiles;</p>
<p>- detect fraudulent behaviour on the Application, such as scams or other abusive behaviour;</p>
<p>- generate profile recommendations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>HAPPN has taken into account, during the design of the Services, and undertakes to continuously take into account (i) the applicable regulations on artificial intelligence, in particular Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2024 establishing harmonised rules on artificial intelligence ("AI Act"), (ii) the general principles and international standards on artificial intelligence, in particular relating to the use of ethical, responsible, and sustainable artificial intelligence technologies and models, (iii) respect for the rights of individuals, in particular their privacy, and (iv) the risks of bias and discrimination, which it will endeavour to limit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>HAPPN makes no warranties with respect to the AI systems used in connection with the Services beyond the applicable provisions of the AI Act.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Article 8: Member Code of Conduct</h1>

<p> </p>

<h2>8.3 Personal Use</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The Member agrees to use the Application solely for personal use. The HAPPN network must not be exploited for commercial, promotional, electoral or recruitment purposes. It is strictly prohibited to send Messages of a marketing and/or commercial nature and/or newsletters via the HAPPN inbox, including but not limited to content, guidelines or hyperlinks to third-party sites or materials, particularly those of HAPPN’s competitors. </p>
<h2>8.4 Member’s Liability</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The Member is only liable for his or her own actions and for the data that he or she publishes via the Application.</p>

<h2>8.6 Real-life Meet-ups</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>HAPPN advises Members who wish to arrange “real-life” meet-ups to be vigilant.  Members are solely responsible for verifying the identity of those with whom they meet. “Real-life” meet-ups are arranged independently of HAPPN and are the sole responsibility of Members. HAPPN cannot be held liable for any acts or problems of any type which have been committed or caused by Members and/or former Members when such events occur following use of the Application.  In this respect, one of the intended benefits of the HAPPN messaging service, again to ensure that Members remain safe and free from harassment, is to enable Members to decide which people should be allowed to see their profiles and talk to them. </p>
<p>As regards the people with whom the Member has agreed to exchange Messages, it is recommended that Members do not too readily reveal information which is not included in the profile such as a phone number, address or surname.  For safety reasons, HAPPN strongly advises that real-life meetings be arranged only in busy public places or that a friend or relative be informed of the meeting and that Members disclose their contact information only after a reasonable period of time.</p>
<h2>8.7 Account Management</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The Member must regularly consult his or her inbox and notifications, which HAPPN will use inter alia to keep the Member updated on information pertaining to its Services. This information may also be sent to the Member’s email address provided by the Member when registering with a cell phone number, or via Apple, Google Sign in, or via the HAPPN Webapp.</p>
<p>The Member may access the Services of his or her Account by connecting to the Application using a confidential user name and password. The Member is solely responsible for his or her login information and must ensure that no third party may access them. In particular, the Member shall specifically hold HAPPN harmless against any communication, use or declaration made using his or her Account.</p>
<h2>8.8 Equipment</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The cost of equipment (hardware or software) required to access the Services together with all other costs related thereto, including telecommunications costs, shall be borne solely by the Member.  The Member is solely responsible for the hardware used to access the Service.</p>

<p>The usage rights granted by HAPPN to the Member are restricted to private and personal use. Any other use by the Member is prohibited without HAPPN’s prior, express and written authorization. </p>
<p>The Member grants HAPPN and its partners a free-of-charge, non-exclusive, international and permanent license for the use, reproduction, representation, modification and translation of any basic intellectual property-related component and personality rights (including rights of image, name, and voice) (text, photos, videos, etc.) that it may provide through the Application for the non-exclusive purpose of communicating with other Members.</p>
<p> </p>

This is to enable the sending of the indicative selection of three profiles to other Members via the Application and via an editorial or themed newsletter sent by email.

<p>• In the event of the Application being re-downloaded during the one-year period following the uninstallation of the Account, the details kept will be reallocated to the profile, which will be active again.</p>
<h2>14.3 Deletion of the Account by the Member</h2>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>By sending a letter or email to HAPPN, whose postal address and email address are shown in Article 15 hereof. </li>

<h2>14.4 Suspension/Termination of the Account by HAPPN in case of breach of TOS</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>In case of breach of TOS by the Member, his or her account can at any time and after prior warning be suspended as a safeguard measure for a reasonable period of time and then terminated as of right by HAPPN.</p>
<p>HAPPN will be entitled to suspend a Member’s account as long as necessary to allow HAPPN’s customer service team to make all investigations necessary following the report as required by Article 7.3 hereof or in case of presumed breach of TOS which may be remediated.</p>
<p>In its decision to suspend the Account, HAPPN will consider the seriousness of the violation and whether it is repeated or isolated. For example, in the event of suspension following misuse of the service, i.e. frequent supply of obviously illicit content and frequent and manifestly unfounded notifications and complaints, HAPPN will consider : </p>
<ul>
<li>the volume of obviously illicit content/notifications or obviously unfounded complaints;</li>
<li>the relative proportion of these items in relation to the total number of items supplied or notifications submitted;</li>
<li>the seriousness of misuse (nature and consequences);</li>
<li>the Member's intention (where this can be determined).</li>
</ul>
<p>The Member is invited to contact HAPPN customer service by email in order to obtain more information on the reasons for the suspension and in order to provide explanations and/or bring the proof that the breach has been remediated. Members may also turn to the internal complaints handling system set up by HAPPN.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If within 30 days following the notification of the account suspension, the Member has not contacted HAPPN customer service, or if the elements given by the Members did not help to remedy the breach, HAPPN will be entitled to notify the Member of termination of his or Account via the Application and/or by email and inform the Member of the period in which he or she cannot re-register for the Application.  Unless stated otherwise, the duration of such removal is set at 1 year from the notification of termination of the Account.</p>
<p>Upon Termination of the Account:</p>
<p>• The Member’s profile will be made invisible to other Members;</p>
<p>• The remaining SuperCrushs or Boosts, in the Member’s Account on the day the Account is terminated shall be definitively deleted without the possibility to claim any reimbursement.</p>
<p>The Member will not be able to create another account for a maximum 1-year period from the notification of the Account termination. </p>
<h2>14.5 Termination of Inactive Accounts by HAPPN</h2>
<p> </p>

<p>An account is considered inactive if after a continuous period of one year, both of the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>• The Application of the Member did not establish contact with HAPPN’s servers (including because of deactivation of the geolocation process); and</p>
<p>• The Member has not used the Application. In any event, the Account of a Subscriber Member is not considered inactive.</p>
<p>The Member will be informed by email sent to the address given in the Application of the deletion of his or her account subject to prior notice of eight (8) days.</p>
<p>During the period of notice, the Member may reactivate his or her Account, which results in the suspension of the termination procedure. All content from the Member’s profile will then be preserved.</p>
<p>At the end of the period of notice and in the absence of a contrary intention expressed by the Member, the Account will be automatically deleted by HAPPN.</p>
<p>Once the Account has been deleted:</p>
<p>• The Member’s profile will be made invisible to other Members.</p>
<p>• The Member’s data shall be retained for one year as of this date, as regards in particular the legal obligations incumbent upon HAPPN in accordance with the terms set out by Article 9 of the Privacy Policy, and shall be permanently deleted thereafter.</p>
<p>• The remaining SuperCrushs or Boosts in the Member’s Account on the day the Account is terminated shall be definitively deleted without the possibility to claim any reimbursement.</p>

Its internal regulations are available on the following page <a href="https://support.happn.fr/hc/en-us/articles/24923334905501-Internal-Complaint-Handling-System-Regulations">https://support.happn.fr/hc/en-us/articles/24923334905501-Internal-Complaint-Handling-System-Regulations</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This complaints handling system may benefit any person who has been the subject of a measure following a report or any person who is dissatisfied with the measure taken by HAPPN following a report. Any person concerned and wishing to contest the measure taken by HAPPN can contact HAPPN at the following e-mail address:<a href="mailto:dispute@happn.com">dispute@happn.com</a>.</p>
<p>You also have the possibility to refer the matter to <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/dsa-out-court-dispute-settlement" target="_blank">a certified out-of-court dispute resolution body </a> or to appeal to the competent court.</p>
<p>Any abuse in the use of the Internal Complaints Handling System (complaints that are manifestly unfounded and made in bad faith) will also be considered a breach of these T&amp;Cs and may result in the suspension/termination of the Account of the Member who committed such abuse, in accordance with Article 14.4 “Suspension/Termination of the Account by HAPPN in the event of a Member’s breach of the T&amp;Cs” of the T&amp;Cs.</p>
