<h1>Article 5: Services and Features</h1>
<h2>5.1 Purpose of the Service</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HAPPN is an online dating application enabling Members to find, in the Application, people with whom they have crossed paths or may cross paths, as well as those likely to interest them. The Application offers Members profiles that are automatically selected&nbsp;using artificial intelligence systems (Â« AIS Â») based on their search preferences, their profile activity on the Application, their Characteristics, favourite places or location. HAPPN undertakes to implement these AIS in accordance with the âAI Systemsâ article of these T&amp;Cs. The Member cannot modify the recommendation criteria. We believe these criteria are the most likely to determine your compatibility with the profiles offered by the Application. However, the information that the Member fills in on his/her profile is likely to influence the recommendations.</p>
<p>Each Member is free to talk to and form relationships with other Members in compliance with these TOS and the law.</p>
<p>The Services offered by HAPPN may in no case be likened to a counseling or marriage bureau service. Its sole aim is to facilitate virtual or real-life meet-ups through the Application between Members with mutual interests, according to their locations and preferences.</p>
<h2>5.2 Services for Members</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of HAPPNâs services are available on the Application free of charge (apart from connection and telecommunications costs) for Members who agree to comply with these TOS, including:</p>
<p>â¢ Sending a limited number of Likes.</p>
<p>â¢ Sending of Messages and voice messages when one has a Crush.</p>
<p>â¢ Viewing of other Membersâ profiles.</p>
<p>â¢ Passing a number of profiles.</p>
<p>â¢ Playing CrushTime.</p>
<p>â¢ Confidentially blocking all Members whose conduct justifies such an action.</p>
<p>â¢ Confidentially reporting all Members whose conduct is contrary to the TOS or applicable law.</p>
<p>â¢ Locating the points at which youâve crossed paths with Members.</p>
<p>â¢ Accessing the list of Members with whom he or she has crossed paths.</p>

<p>â¢ Completing his or her profile in compliance with the TOS.</p>
<p>â¢ Deleting Messages.</p>
<p>Charged services provided via the Application are available to Members after purchasing a Pack or a HAPPN subscription, the conditions of which are set out in article 9.</p>
<h1>Article 6: Protection of Personal Data</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HAPPN is very concerned with the protection of your personal data and the respect of your privacy. We suggest that you read our Privacy Policy and our Confidence Charter carefully to better understand how we process your personal data, available by clicking on the following links:&nbsp;</p>
<p>â¢ <a href="https://www.happn.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a></p>
<p>â¢ <a href="https://www.happn.com/trust">Confidence Charter</a></p>
<h1>Article 7: HAPPNâs Obligations and Liability</h1>
<h2>7.1 Technical Resources and Security</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HAPPN agrees to provide the infrastructure and technical resources to provide a high-quality service to Members with an iPhone device running operating system version iOS 10 or higher, an Android Smartphone running version 5 or higher.</p>
<p>HAPPN cannot be held liable for any operating fault on the Memberâs device or for any compatibility issue between the Application and the device.</p>
<p>In addition, every effort is made to ensure that the risks of fraudulent access to HAPPNâs system are minimized.&nbsp; In this respect, HAPPN uses a firewall or equipment located between the Internet and the companyâs private network, in order to make its security more robust by filtering traffic to and from the internet. It is, however, impossible to fully guarantee the security of a network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HAPPN is not responsible for any failures, interruptions or poor performance of the Memberâs internet provider Services, or for any cause beyond HAPPNâs control which might interrupt or have an adverse effect on access to HAPPN Services.</p>
<p>The Member must have access to a secure email account. If such a precaution is not taken, or even if it is, while this probability remains low, the Memberâs Account may be vulnerable to fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HAPPN shall also endeavor to avert Members of any exceptional risk of receiving spam Messages or Messages claiming to have been sent by HAPPN. The Member must be attentive and vigilant in order to avoid being the victim of scams and report any of the above circumstances to HAPPN by sending a letter or email to the address provided in Article 15 hereof.</p>
<h2>7.2 Illegal Conduct&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HAPPN and its partners cannot be held liable for actions by its Members which are illegal or which incur criminal penalties, including but not limited to:</p>
<p>â¢ All types of scams,&nbsp;</p>
<p>â¢ All activities of a commercial or professional nature,</p>
<p>â¢ Prostitution,</p>
<p>â¢ Identity theft,</p>
<p>â¢ An infringement of a third-party intellectual property right,</p>
<p>â¢ An infringement of personal rights, such as image rights and the respect of the right to privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>â¢ Any such behaviour may result in the suspension or termination of these terms and conditions of use in accordance with Article 15.4 herein.</p>
<h2>7.3 Reporting and Community Moderation System</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HAPPN, as host, is not bound by any general obligation to monitor the content transmitted or stored via the Application pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 of 19 October 2022 on a single market for digital services (âDigital Services Regulationâ).</p>
<p>However, in accordance with Article 16 of the Digital Services Regulation, HAPPN shall set up a notification system to report illegal, abusive and harmful content.</p>
<p>In this case, after verification by Customer Services, HAPPN undertakes to promptly remove the manifestly illegal content.</p>
<p>In addition, the Application allows Members to report content&nbsp;if it constitutes apology for crimes against humanity, apology for and incitement to terrorism, incitement to racial hatred, incitement to hatred based on gender, sexual orientation or handicap and inter alia child pornography, incitement to violence against women and violation of human dignity.</p>
<p>Guided by an extremely strict professional ethic and refusing any association with violent or insulting Members as well as unlawful, abusive or prejudicial content, HAPPNâs team takes this reporting procedure very seriously, which may also be implemented in the case of statements contrary to accepted social etiquette.</p>
<p>Hence, when the content published by a Member is reported, the transmitterâs account can be suspended or terminated according to the conditions set forth in Article 14.4. This decision is based on the proof given by the reportâs author and is made in order to ensure the withdrawal of the content in compliance with HAPPNâs legal obligations.</p>
<p>The Member having originally published the reported content will in no case be informed of the identity of the reportâs author.</p>
<p>Outside the scope of this reporting system, the Member can decide to block another Member whose conduct does not comply with the rules of etiquette in order to prevent any conversation with him or her (mutual prevention of access to Likes, SuperCrushs, Messages and voice messages that have been sent in the past and of sending any messages in the future, or being alerted of the presence of a Member who has been blocked, particularly if they think this Member is bothering them in one way or another).&nbsp; This action is confidential and enables Members to control the Members with whom they want to keep in touch or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This reporting system is accessible and operational:&nbsp;</p>
<p>â¢ On iPhone: At the bottom of the Member's profile and at the top right corner of the conversation with the Member concerned.</p>
<p>â¢ On Android smartphones: At the bottom of the Member's profile and at the top right corner of the conversation with the Member concerned.</p>
<p>Should content be published that was reported and that may be seen as a violation of law or regulations, the Member who is a victim of this content is encouraged to submit a complaint to the appropriate police authorities.</p>
<p>The reporting system put in place by HAPPN does not replace any complaint and judicial procedure against a Member who authored the reported content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any misuse of the community moderation system&nbsp;or any unjustified reporting of a Member (manifestly unfounded reports made in bad faith) shall be considered a breach of these TOS, and penalties may be imposed including Account suspension/termination, pursuant to Article 14.4 Â« Suspension/Termination of the Account by HAPPN in the event that a Member violates the terms and conditions of use Â» of the TOS, besides application of penalties pursuant to Article 6.I-4 of the French Trust in the Digital Economy Act or even legal proceedings, under which damages may have to be paid to victims.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, in accordance with its Privacy Policy, HAPPN puts measures in place to support its Members' peace of mind and security on the Application.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>7.4 Duty of Caution</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Member is solely liable for checking the identity of the people with whom he or she wishes to arrange a âreal-lifeâ meet-up. HAPPN may not be held liable for any problems whatsoever arising from a âreal-lifeâ meet-up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, the Member is solely liable for checking the identity of the Crush with whom they may want to engage in a Video Call and organize a âvirtualâ meetup. HAPPN may not be held liable for any incidents occurring during a âvirtualâ meetup.</p>
<h2>7.5 Group Events</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any use of HAPPN Services to organize a group meeting of its Members constitutes a misuse of the Service. This is why using the Application to plan or organize a demonstration in a public place is strictly prohibited. Should such a meeting take place, HAPPN may not be held liable in the case of a public order offense or any damage caused by such meeting.</p>
<h2><br>7.6 AI Systems</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HAPPN uses AI systems to:</p>
<p>- detect fake profiles;</p>
<p>- detect fraudulent behaviour on the Application, such as scams or other abusive behaviour;</p>
<p>- generate profile recommendations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HAPPN has taken into account, during the design of the Services, and undertakes to continuously take into account (i) the applicable regulations on artificial intelligence, in particular Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2024 establishing harmonised rules on artificial intelligence ("AI Act"), (ii) the general principles and international standards on artificial intelligence, in particular relating to the use of ethical, responsible, and sustainable artificial intelligence technologies and models, (iii) respect for the rights of individuals, in particular their privacy, and (iv) the risks of bias and discrimination, which it will endeavour to limit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HAPPN makes no warranties with respect to the AI systems used in connection with the Services beyond the applicable provisions of the AI Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the duration of the investigation, HAPPN reserves the right to suspend the Account of any Member giving cause for suspicion as well as his or her access to the Application, and to conduct the necessary checks, in particular by asking him or her to send a copy of an official ID. The Member will be informed of the suspension of his or her Account via the application and/or by email to the address given by the Member pursuant to Article 14.4 hereof.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in the event of obviously abusive or excessive behaviour by the Member, especially if it is repeated and/or unfounded, with the intention of using&nbsp; the paid Services offered on the Application for free, HAPPN reserves the right to suspend the Member's Account under the terms of Article 15.4 of these terms and conditions of use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(iv) to attempt to circumvent the featureâs safety measures or to use the feature for purposes other than the ones it is intended for, i.e., calling and communicating with your Crush spontaneously via video call for a limited duration.</p>
<h2>8.3 Personal Use</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Member agrees to use the Application solely for personal use. The HAPPN network must not be exploited for commercial, promotional, electoral or recruitment purposes.

<h2>8.4 Memberâs Liability</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Member is only liable for his or her own actions and for the data that he or she publishes via the Application.</p>

<h2>8.6 Real-life Meet-ups</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HAPPN advises Members who wish to arrange âreal-lifeâ meet-ups to be vigilant.&nbsp; Members are solely responsible for verifying the identity of those with whom they meet. âReal-lifeâ meet-ups are arranged independently of HAPPN and are the sole responsibility of Members. HAPPN cannot be held liable for any acts or problems of any type which have been committed or caused by Members and/or former Members when such events occur following use of the Application.&nbsp; In this respect, one of the intended benefits of the HAPPN messaging service, again to ensure that Members remain safe and free from harassment, is to enable Members to decide which people should be allowed to see their profiles and talk to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As regards the people with whom the Member has agreed to exchange Messages, it is recommended that Members do not too readily reveal information which is not included in the profile such as a phone number, address or surname.&nbsp; For safety reasons, HAPPN strongly advises that real-life meetings be arranged only in busy public places or that a friend or relative be informed of the meeting and that Members disclose their contact information only after a reasonable period of time.</p>
<h2>8.7 Account Management</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Member must regularly consult his or her inbox and notifications, which HAPPN will use inter alia to keep the Member updated on information pertaining to its Services. This information may also be sent to the Memberâs email address&nbsp;provided by the Member when registering with a cell phone number, or via Apple, Google Sign in, or via the HAPPN Webapp.</p>
<p>The Member may access the Services of his or her Account by connecting to the Application using a confidential user name and password. The Member is solely responsible for his or her login information and must ensure that no third party may access them. In particular, the Member shall specifically hold HAPPN harmless against any communication, use or declaration made using his or her Account.</p>
<h2>8.8 Equipment</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cost of equipment (hardware or software) required to access the Services together with all other costs related thereto, including telecommunications costs, shall be borne solely by the Member.&nbsp; The Member is solely responsible for the hardware used to access the Service.</p>

<p><strong>HAPPN has no direct control over payment, exchange rate or transfer of funds nor on any possible fees inherent to these operations. Consequently, the Apple App Store and Google Play Store alone are liable for their payment terms and processes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is why HAPPN has no control over reimbursement of your purchase. Any requests related to payment must be sent to your Store.</strong></p>
<p>HAPPN does not collect any banking information. Your bank details are collected and processed directly by Apple or Google and remain outside of HAPPNâs control.</p>
<p><strong>Payment by debit card.</strong> Payment by debit card is possible on the Web Application and the Mobile Application on Android. It is managed via the Stripe payment platform. Any request relating to payment via the Web Application must be addressed to HAPPN's customer service department.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HAPPN does not collect any banking data. Your bank details are collected and processed directly by Stripe.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>9.5 Contract Term and Renewal of the HAPPN Subscription</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Member chooses to take out a HAPPN subscription, he/she will be bound from the date of subscription. The HAPPN access contract is binding between the parties from the date of its conclusion and for the duration of the chosen subscription period. In the event of termination by the Member before the end of the subscription period, the sums paid to HAPPN for this period will be forfeited and will not be returned to the Member.</p>
<p>Subscriptions are automatically renewed by default, unless the Member cancels using the dedicated function on the platform on which the Member has taken out the subscription (on the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store or the Application), which have a function enabling all subscriptions with application providers to be cancelled 24 hours before the previous subscription expires.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the event of renewal of the subscription, and on receipt of automatic payment from your Store, HAPPN will validate your purchase and update your account, giving you access to HAPPN for a period corresponding to the amount received.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to use the default âautomatic renewalâ option, simply deactivate it by following the instructions in the following link: <a href="https://support.happn.fr/hc/articles/16325271853981"> access our FAQ.</a></p>
<p>If you wish to circumvent this automatic renewal at the end of the subscription term set up by the Stores, you must deactivate it.</p>
<h2>9.6 Withdrawal Rights</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As specified in article 9.5 of these TOS, payments are processed and managed entirely by the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store, such that the right of withdrawal, if applicable, must be exercised directly through the App Store or Google Play.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consequently, when a Member decides to exercise this right to withdrawal, he or she must notify the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store, depending on the type of device used at the time of purchase:</p>
<p>For the Play Store, follow the instructions that appear in the following link to access the terms and conditions for exercising your right to withdrawal from Google Play and to the model form: <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7205930?ctx=7659581&amp;visit_id=636923806604702476-265013927&amp;rd=1&amp;co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop&amp;oco=1">access here.</a></p>

<h2>9.7 Early Termination of the Contract by the Member or by HAPPN&nbsp;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the event of breach of the TOS or a legal provision by the Member, HAPPN has the right to terminate the contract, effective immediately and without prejudice. HAPPN is not required to justify its decision to terminate to the Member.</p>
<p>In all cases, no reimbursement will be made if the Member is a HAPPN subscriber or has purchased Packs (of SuperCrushs and/or Boosts).</p>
<h1>Article 10: Scope of the Offer</h1>
<h2>10.1 SuperCrushs and Boost Validity Period</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SuperCrushs and/or Boosts purchased and/or offered by HAPPN may only be used for the term during which the Account remains active, in compliance with the TOS.&nbsp; In the event of early termination of the Account pursuant to Article 14.3, 14.4 or 14.5 hereafter, any remaining SuperCrushs and/or Boosts at the date of termination or deletion of the Member Account shall be permanently deleted from the Member Account, without compensation of any kind.</p>
<p>A subsequent re-registration of the Member will not allow him or her to recover the lost SuperCrushs and/or Boosts.</p>
<p>HAPPN may offer SuperCrushs to Members as part of its loyalty program or for a special event.</p>
<h2>10.2 Cumulative Offers</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Packs of SuperCrushs or Boosts are cumulative. The number of SuperCrushs and Boosts in each Pack purchased is added to the SuperCrushs and Boosts already in the Memberâs Account.</p>
<p>Packs of SuperCrushs are also cumulative with subscriptions, meaning that they allow users to benefit from more SuperCrushs than those to which Premium Subscribers have access.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Article 11: Communication with the Member</h1>
<h2>11.1 Push Notifications</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Member may receive push notifications through the Application to notify him or her of important events, including but not limited to:&nbsp;</p>
<p>â¢ A SuperCrushs received from another Membre,</p>
<p>â¢ A Message or vocal message received from another Member,</p>

<p>The Member may change his or her push notification preferences through his or her Account settings.</p>
<h2>11.2 Newsletter</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon registration with the Application, the Member receives a newsletter from HAPPN.&nbsp; The Member may unsubscribe at any time by clicking on the âunsubscribeâ link provided in the newsletter and/or by exercising his or her right of refusal by sending an email to the address provided in Article 15 of the TOS.</p>
<h2>11.3 Advertising and Promotional Messages</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HAPPN is free to post, within the scope of execution of the contract and through the Application, advertising and promotional messages from advertisers and any other partner.</p>
<h1>Article 12: Intellectual Property</h1>
<h2>12.1 Prerogatives related to Trademark Law</h2>

<p>Any reproduction and/or use and/or partial and/or total affixing and/or modification and/or deletion of the trademark and related rights, such as for example (without limitation) the Applicationâs slogan and logo, through any method whatsoever and in any form whatsoever, in any format or through any medium whatsoever, is strictly prohibited without HAPPNâs prior, express and written authorization, and may give rise to legal proceedings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trademark is protected by Articles L713-2 et seq. of the French Intellectual Property Code (Code de la propriÃ©tÃ© intellectuelle) currently in force in France, and this protection is international.</p>
<h2>12.2 Prerogatives related to Copyright</h2>

<p>The original works provided by HAPPN are exclusively owned by HAPPN. HAPPN holds all of the related rights.</p>
<p>Any representation and/or reproduction and/or distribution and/or partial and/or total exploitation of the content and Services provided by the Application, such as for example the software, animations, text, photos, videos, graphics and more broadly the general structure, through any method whatsoever and in any form whatsoever, in any format or through any medium whatsoever, is strictly prohibited without HAPPNâs prior, express and written authorization, and may give rise to legal proceedings.</p>
<p>These original works are protected by Articles L335-3 et seq. of the French Intellectual Property Code (Code de la propriÃ©tÃ© intellectuelle) currently in force in France, and this protection is international.</p>
<h2>12.3 License</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The usage rights granted by HAPPN to the Member are restricted to private and personal use. Any other use by the Member is prohibited without HAPPNâs prior, express and written authorization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Member grants HAPPN and its partners a free-of-charge, non-exclusive, international and permanent license for the use, reproduction, representation, modification and translation of any basic intellectual property-related component and personality rights (including rights of image, name, and voice) (text, photos, videos, etc.) that it may provide through the Application for the non-exclusive purpose of communicating with other Members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HAPPN shall use this license in a manner which complies with image rights, respect of personality attributes, and respect of the right to privacy which protects the userâs personal data, without misrepresenting the true nature of the Memberâs profile and therefore in keeping with this profile. This license permits HAPPN to ensure that these components are compatible with its technical performance or the required media formats. These rights are granted on an international basis and throughout the performance of these TOS between the Member and HAPPN.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Member shall retain ownership of any content and personal data that he or she provides.</p>
<p>The Member shall hold HAPPN harmless against any legal action, appeal or conviction brought against him or her due to his or her infringement of a third partyâs intellectual property rights. The Member shall hold HAPPN harmless against any claims or damages which may result from it including, but not limited to, requests for compensation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the Profile recommendation service, the Member grants HAPPN the same rights and guarantees of use as described in the aforementioned license. This is to enable the sending of the indicative selection of three profiles to other Members via the Application and via an editorial or themed newsletter sent by email. It should be noted that this list of recommendations may be different to the one the Member may find in their Profile on the HAPPN Application as Profiles are continuously refined based on their relevance and status.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Article 13: Counterfeiting, Unfair Competition and Parasitism</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is strictly prohibited to design a product similar to the Application or to create a derivative, and more generally to be guilty of parasitism, imitation, a smear campaign or any other act of unfair competition. HAPPN reserves the right, in this case, to serve a writ on the Member in question in view of obtaining compensation for the injury caused by the Member.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Member who succeeds in or attempts to grant licenses or sub-licenses, or to sell, resell, transfer, assign, distribute or commercially exploit in any other way, or to make available the Services or Application to a third party in any way shall risk serious legal penalties.</p>
<h1>Article 14: Termination&nbsp;</h1>
<h2>14.1 Deactivation of the Account by the Member</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Member may deactivate his or her Account without notice through the Application if he or she no longer wishes to be visible on it.</p>
<p>Once the profile has been deactivated:</p>
<p>â¢ The Memberâs profile will be made invisible to other Members in the past, present and future.</p>
<p>â¢ There will be no change to the legal obligation for data retention.</p>
<p>â¢ In the event of an Account being reactivated during the one-year period following the closure of the Account, the details kept will be reallocated to the profile, which will be visible again.</p>
<h2>14.2 Uninstallation of the Application by the Member</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Member may uninstall the Application from his or her cell phone at any time without notice. Consequently, the Member shall have no further access to the Application unless he or she downloads it again.</p>
<p>â¢ The uninstallation of the Application does not delete the Memberâs Account. It is therefore recommended to delete your Account on the Application before uninstalling it.</p>
<p>â¢ The uninstallation of the Application has no incidence on the legal obligation for data retention.</p>
<p>â¢ In the event of the Application being re-downloaded during the one-year period following the uninstallation of the Account, the details kept will be reallocated to the profile, which will be active again.</p>
<h2>14.3 Deletion of the Account by the Member</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Member may decide, at any time and without notice, to permanently delete his or her Account using one of the following means:</p>
<ul>
<li>By deleting it of his or her own accord from the Application, by going to the Settings of the application &gt; My data &gt; Delete my account.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>By sending a letter or email to HAPPN, whose postal address and email address are shown in Article 15 hereof.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Consequently, the Memberâs profile will be permanently deleted, including the remaining SuperCrushs or Boosts in his or her Account.</p>
<p>Further, the subscriber Member who decides to delete his or her Account can terminate their subscription to HAPPN by contacting the Apple App Store or Google Play Store by following the instructions found in the following link: <a href="https://support.happn.fr/hc/articles/16325271853981">access our FAQ.</a></p>
<p>Should the Member wish to start using the Application again after deleting his Account, he or she must register under the same terms and conditions as the initial registration.</p>
<p>Once the Account has been deleted:</p>
<p>â¢ The Memberâs profile will be made invisible to other Members.</p>
<p>â¢ The Memberâs data shall be retained for one year as of this date, as regards in particular the legal obligations incumbent upon HAPPN in accordance with the terms set out by Article 9 of the Privacy Policy, and shall be permanently deleted thereafter.</p>
<p>â¢ The remaining SuperCrushs or Boosts in the Memberâs Account on the day the Account is deleted shall be definitively lost without the possibility to claim any reimbursement.</p>
<p>The Member cannot reactivate his or her old Account.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>14.4 Suspension/Termination of the Account by HAPPN in case of breach of TOS</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case of breach of TOS by the Member, his or her account can at any time and after prior warning be suspended as a safeguard measure for a reasonable period of time and then terminated as of right by HAPPN.</p>
<p>HAPPN will be entitled to suspend a Memberâs account as long as necessary to allow HAPPNâs customer service team to make all investigations necessary following the report as required by Article 7.3 hereof or in case of presumed breach of TOS which may be remediated.</p>
<p>In its decision to suspend the Account, HAPPN will consider the seriousness of the violation and whether it is repeated or isolated. For example, in the event of suspension following misuse of the service, i.e. frequent supply of obviously illicit content and frequent and manifestly unfounded notifications and complaints, HAPPN will consider :&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>the volume of obviously illicit content/notifications or obviously unfounded complaints;</li>
<li>the relative proportion of these items in relation to the total number of items supplied or notifications submitted;</li>
<li>the seriousness of misuse (nature and consequences);</li>
<li>the Member's intention (where this can be determined).</li>
</ul>
<p>The Member is invited to contact HAPPN customer service by email in order to obtain more information on the reasons for the suspension and in order to provide explanations and/or bring the proof that the breach has been remediated. Members may also turn to the internal complaints handling system set up by HAPPN.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If within 30 days following the notification of the account suspension, the Member has not contacted HAPPN customer service, or if the elements given by the Members did not help to remedy the breach, HAPPN will be entitled to notify the Member of termination of his or Account via the Application and/or by email and inform the Member of the period in which he or she cannot re-register for the Application.&nbsp; Unless stated otherwise, the duration of such removal is set at 2 years from the notification of termination of the Account.</p>
<p>Upon Termination of the Account:</p>
<p>â¢ The Memberâs profile will be made invisible to other Members;</p>
<p>â¢ The remaining SuperCrushs or Boosts, in the Memberâs Account on the day the Account is terminated shall be definitively deleted without the possibility to claim any reimbursement.</p>
<p>The Member will not be able to create another account for a maximum 2-years period from the notification of the Account termination.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>14.5 Termination of Inactive Accounts by HAPPN</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HAPPN will delete inactive accounts as defined below.</p>
<p>An account is considered inactive if after a continuous period of one year, both of the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>â¢ The Application of the Member did not establish contact with HAPPNâs servers (including because of deactivation of the geolocation process); and</p>
<p>â¢ The Member has not used the Application. In any event, the Account of a Subscriber Member is not considered inactive.</p>
<p>The Member will be informed by email sent to the address given in the Application of the deletion of his or her account subject to prior notice of eight (8) days.</p>
<p>During the period of notice, the Member may reactivate his or her Account, which results in the suspension of the termination procedure. All content from the Memberâs profile will then be preserved.</p>
<p>At the end of the period of notice and in the absence of a contrary intention expressed by the Member, the Account will be automatically deleted by HAPPN.</p>
<p>Once the Account has been deleted:</p>
<p>â¢ The Memberâs profile will be made invisible to other Members.</p>
<p>â¢ The Memberâs data shall be retained for one year as of this date, as regards in particular the legal obligations incumbent upon HAPPN in accordance with the terms set out by Article 9 of the Privacy Policy, and shall be permanently deleted thereafter.</p>
<p>â¢ The remaining SuperCrushs or Boosts in the Memberâs Account on the day the Account is terminated shall be definitively deleted without the possibility to claim any reimbursement.</p>
<p>The Member will not be able to reactivate nor request reactivation of his/her old Account.</p>
<h1>Article 15: Contact&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HAPPN may be contacted by mail at 5 rue Feydeau, 75002, Paris (France).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Members may also contact HAPPN by email at the following address: <a href="mailto:support@happn.com">support@happn.com</a>.</p>
<h1>Article 16: Confidentiality Clause&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neither HAPPN nor the Member are authorized to disclose information about the agreement between them, and each party agrees to comply with a confidentiality clause which requires them to prefer confidential negotiations in the event of a disagreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 		<h1>Article 17: Internal Complaints Handling System</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Application is considered to be an âintermediary serviceâ within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 October 2022 on a single market for digital services and amending Directive 2000/31/EC (the âDigital Services Regulationâ or âDSRâ), which entered into force on 17 February 2024.</p>
<p>In accordance with Article 20 of the Digital Services Regulation, HAPPN has set up an internal complaints handling system (the â <strong>Complaints Handling System</strong> â). Its internal regulations are available on the following page <a href="https://support.happn.fr/hc/en-us/articles/24923334905501-Internal-Complaint-Handling-System-Regulations">https://support.happn.fr/hc/en-us/articles/24923334905501-Internal-Complaint-Handling-System-Regulations</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This complaints handling system may benefit any person who has been the subject of a measure following a report or any person who is dissatisfied with the measure taken by HAPPN following a report. Any person concerned and wishing to contest the measure taken by HAPPN can contact HAPPN at the following e-mail address:<a href="mailto:dispute@happn.com">dispute@happn.com</a>.</p>
<p>You also have the possibility to refer the matter to <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/dsa-out-court-dispute-settlement" target="_blank">a certified out-of-court dispute resolution body </a>&nbsp;or to appeal to the competent court.</p>
<p>Any abuse in the use of the Internal Complaints Handling System (complaints that are manifestly unfounded and made in bad faith) will also be considered a breach of these T&amp;Cs and may result in the suspension/termination of the Account of the Member who committed such abuse, in accordance with Article 14.4 âSuspension/Termination of the Account by HAPPN in the event of a Memberâs breach of the T&amp;Csâ of the T&amp;Cs.</p>
