<p align="left"><strong>HILY PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>Effective Date</strong>: 15 December 2022</p>
<p align="left"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p align="left">Hily Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) explains all the privacy matters you may face when using our website, <a href="https://hily.com/">https://hily.com</a><u>&nbsp;</u>and other websites run by Hily (the “Website”) and Hily’s mobile and web-based applications (the “App”), jointly the “Service”, operated by Hily Corp. (“Hily” or “we”).</p>
<p align="left">This Policy is an integral part of the <a href="https://hily.com/terms?locale=EN">Hily’s Terms of Use</a> (the “Terms”) and incorporated by reference into them. Please read this Policy carefully and if you have any questions, feel free to contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c0aca5a7a1ac80a8a9acb9eea3afad"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="452920222429052d2c293c6b262a28">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. In case you have any ongoing questions about how to exercise your rights, etc., you may also contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#85f6f0f5f5eaf7f1c5edece9fcabe6eae8"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="53202623233c2127133b3a3f2a7d303c3e">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>
<p align="left">Some services which may be employed by either Hily or you to interact with the Services may have their own privacy rules (third-party privacy policies). Thus, if your personal data is processed by such services, such processing is governed by third-party privacy policies, not this present Policy.</p>
<p align="left">By using the Service, you agree that the collection and processing of your data will be covered by the terms of this Policy.</p>
<p align="left">
<br>
</p>
<p align="left"><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Initial Notice to Users</strong></p>
<p align="left">
 <br>
</p>
<p align="left"><strong>1.1.&nbsp;</strong>Here, at Hily, we strive to protect your privacy. It goes without saying, by being a place for building the best connections between people, that the App exists as a vast social network, where users may share their experiences, show emotions and just be themselves. All of those actions are connected to personal data sharing. Your “personal data” or just “data” means any information linked with you or the one that may identify you directly or indirectly as a person.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>1.2.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Privacy tips</strong>. Despite our best efforts, we cannot control how other users or third-party services may use your data. When using Hily, you should presume that everything you post, share or message on the App may be publicly viewable and accessible, both by Hily users and people outside the App. We want you to be careful about going public with your data, thus, we kindly ask you to follow our privacy recommendations as below:</p>
<p align="left">(a) when you post information about yourself or use the messaging function, the amount of personal information you share is determined at your own risk.</p>
<p align="left">(b) you share information with other users when you voluntarily disclose information on the Service (including your Hily profile). That is why we recommend and encourage you to think carefully about the information you disclose about yourself. Please be careful with your data and make sure that the information you publish is data you feel comfortable being publicly viewable;</p>
<p align="left">(c) we do <strong>not</strong> recommend that you put email addresses, URLs, instant messaging details, phone numbers, full names or addresses, credit card details, national identity numbers, drivers’ license details and other important data on your Hily profile or send that data via direct messages to people that you do not trust;</p>
<p align="left">(d) we do <strong>not</strong> recommend that you share your sensitive data (religious denomination, sexual preferences, health details, political leanings, any kind of addictions, etc.) with other users. If you really desire to share this data safely (so as to set up more relevant connections, etc.), you may use Hily tags features. Regarding Hily tags, please read section 1.3 hereof to find out the benefits of their use;</p>
<p align="left">(e) photos that you share via Hily may reveal much information about you; please inspect all of them for data or objects that you do not want to go public with before you upload or share your photos;</p>
<p align="left">(f) please make sure you log out of your Hily profile after use from either your or a third-party’s device since you never know who may get access to them;</p>
<p align="left">(g) please do not share your access credentials (login, email, password, phone number, etc.) with Hily or other social media profiles with anyone else;</p>
<p align="left">(h) we recommend that you change your Hily and other social media password from time to time;</p>
<p align="left">(i) if you think or even have the slightest suspicion that someone may have had access to your Hily or social media profile or access credentials, first of all, change them immediately; if you lost your access to the profile owing to third-party activity, we recommend that you contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c7b4b2b7b7a8b5b387afaeabbee9a4a8aa"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="96e5e3e6e6f9e4e2d6fefffaefb8f5f9fb">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> (if there is no access to Hily profile) or report the issue to the relevant social media platform;</p>
<p align="left">(j) we kindly draw your attention to the fact that you are the only person who must care about your access credentials’ safety. Remember that in the event they are compromised, a third party may get your data. We cannot guarantee your data security if you lose control of your account and do not notify Hily about the issue.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>1.3.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Hily tags</strong>. Instead of sharing some of your data in a text description of your profile, we recommend that you use Hily tags to identify you as a person of a specific style. We find it a more secure and beneficial option since you may change them or hide them anytime you choose. Meanwhile, Hily tags allow you to create better connections with people who may share your views and are more likely to say “hello”. You may also choose to add information about yourself that may be categorized as sensitive data under your local data privacy laws, e.g., when you add certain Hily tags to your profile, such as your religion and political leanings, sexual preferences, etc. We do not usually indicate those tags as necessary for the registration, so you may choose not to add that data. If you fill that information, including through adding certain tags to your profile, you are explicitly consenting to our processing of your information and making this public to other users. Still, all any time, you are entitled to make us stop showing that data to others by deleting relevant tags in your profile settings, restricting some users from accessing your profile (in this case just blocked users will not see your data) or requesting that we delete your tags or other data at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ee9d9b9e9e819c9aae86878297c08d8183"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a6d5d3d6d6c9d4d2e6cecfcadf88c5c9cb">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. For the users who are California residents, you may find the categories of sensitive personal information that may be publicly viewable and accessible both by users and non-users of the App in section 9.2. hereof.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Changes and Updates to Policy</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>2.1.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Reasons of Updates</strong>. We may revise the Policy according to new developments or advances in legislation and the broader data protection landscape from time to time, so please check this page regularly to ensure you’re always up-to-date with any changes.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>2.2.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Communication on Updates</strong>. If we make any changes hereto that, in our sole discretion, are substantial, we will notify you by email (to the address associated with your profile) or via the App, post a notice within Hily Services or make a notification appear in your profile when you next log in to Hily before amendments become effective. A notification regarding other changes may be rendered to you by publishing at <a href="https://hily.com/privacypolicy">https://hily.com/privacypolicy</a>.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>3.6.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Additional Data Processors</strong>. Where there is a necessity, we may also engage additional service providers, contractors and third parties services and may share the data with them. That will help us operate, provide, improve, integrate, customize, support, and market our Service and the Website. We share the data, in particular, for purposes indicated herein. The types of service providers we may share information with include, in particular: cloud storage providers, data analytics providers, measurement partners, marketing partners, payment processing providers, communication services providers, etc.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>3.7.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Moderation Practices.</strong> We use moderators to monitor and review accounts (including name and any other information uploaded onto user profiles). If the user`s profile meets certain criteria that demonstrate that the user is likely to breach the Terms of Use, the relevant profile will be subject to a warning and the user’s access restricted and/or blocked. Affected Users can contact Hily to contest the decision.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>3.8.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Third Parties: Other Users and Social Media</strong>. Some of your data is publicly available; it means that other users of Hily may have access to your data with which you go public. Please read section 1 carefully and follow our privacy recommendation in order to avoid any undesirable or accidental disclosure of your data. Meanwhile, as we explained in sections 3.4(f)-(h), Hily users have an option to register or log in to the App using Facebook, Snapchat or Apple profile. If you act so, you are authorizing us (and in some cases, other users) to access some of your information placed in your external profiles, including information you make available via these social media, your friends list, current location and those friends you have in common with other Hily users etc. With this regard, please note the following:</p>
<p align="left">(a) any of your data placed in your profile will be shared with other Hily users;</p>
<p align="left">(b) any of your data placed in your profile, as well as your entire profile, may be shared by other Hily users with any third parties (for instance, so as to recommend you to a user’s friend as a potential partner or a buddy);</p>
<p align="left">(c) any user may take a photo or a screenshot of your data. We do prohibit such actions! Still, we cannot track or prevent sharing of taken images;</p>
<p align="left">(d) if you registered your Hily profile using Facebook, Snapchat or Apple profile, your external profile may be visible for other Hily users;</p>
<p align="left">(e) if you registered your Hily profile using Facebook, Snapchat or Apple profile (which means that you connected your Hily profile and Facebook, Snapchat or Apple profile), you authorize such social media to access to some of your data. We kindly recommend that you read their privacy policies since Hily does not control how they use your personal data in that case;</p>
<p align="left">(f) if you do not want to have your Hily profile linked to your profile on the third-party websites, please visit your Facebook, Snapchat or Apple profile and follow the instructions of those social media to remove the Hily access permissions.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>3.9.&nbsp;</strong>Please note we collect personal data directly from you and we may also receive some of your personal data from third parties. For example:</p>
<p align="left">(a) From other social networks: when you connect to your Hily mobile application user account through one of your other social network accounts (e.g. Facebook account);</p>
<p align="left">(b) From other partners: some of our partners may transmit personal data about you (for example when you access our website by clicking on an advert for the Hily mobile application published on a partner's website);</p>
<p align="left">(c) From other users: other users of the Hily mobile application may provide us with personal data about you when they use our services (for example, when they contact us about you or mention information about you in their discussions with other users).</p>
<p align="left"><strong>3.10.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Third Parties: Law Protection and Enforcement Bodies; Attorneys-at-Law.&nbsp;</strong>Hily is a place free of any kind of abuse, violence, laws and third-party rights infringement. We designed Hily as a safe harbor for people to be themselves and express their emotions. We do our utmost to protect our biggest value, sense of security of our users, so we may disclose your data to third parties in the following cases:</p>
<p align="left">(a) we will cooperate with law enforcement inquiries from within or outside your country of residence where we are required to by law, where there is an investigation into alleged criminal behaviour or to protect the vital interests of a person. We may share any personal data that we hold about you, depending on the nature of the request or the issue that we are dealing with;</p>
<p align="left">(b) we will disclose your data if it’s necessary so as to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal request of a state body (a law protection or enforcement body). We may share any personal data that we hold about you, depending on the nature of the request or the issue that we are dealing with;</p>
<p align="left">(c) we may also cooperate with all third parties to enforce their intellectual property or other rights in the event we are notified of an offence by one of our users. Still, we will share your data if we receive respective and motivated legal request of such by the third party’s attorney-at-law, proving your violation only. We may share any personal data that we hold about you, depending on the nature of the request or the issue that we are dealing with. Please note, if we find no proof sufficiently established in an inquiry, we will not disclose your data;</p>
<p align="left">(d) society may be cruel at times; wrong words or actions of others may hurt. Still, this is not a reason to harm yourself. Here, at Hily, we believe that every issue can be fixed, and we are ready to share contact details of our partners who may offer professional help. If we detect suicidal behavior by our users, we may report such a case to the police or professional non-governmental organization, so as to prevent our users from making the biggest mistake of their lives. We may share your name, contact details and geolocation with those bodies;</p>
<p align="left">(e) we may transfer your data to a respective law protection or enforcement body if we detect illegal activity or we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person. We may share any personal data that we hold about you, depending on the nature of the violation or the issue that we are dealing with; and finally</p>
<p align="left">(f) we will share your data with our lawyers, a court, arbitrators, or any authorized professional etc. if we detect your conduct is in breach of <a href="https://hily.com/terms?locale=EN">Hily’s Terms of Use</a> or any integral parts thereto or in order to protect the rights and property of Hily, its affiliates, or the public or to comply with legal and regulatory obligations.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>5.5.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Legal Bases</strong>. Legal bases are the grounds set forth by the GDPR on which we may process your data. We rely on the following legal bases:</p>
<p align="left">(a) performing the contract with you — the main legal basis that we use to process your data. It includes mostly everything we do to provide you with services, under our Terms of Use and their appendices. You may restrict us from processing of your data, but please be advised that, in such a case, we will not be able to provide services to you. Please see section 8 to find out more;</p>
<p align="left">(b) legal obligation — we may process your data when we have a legal obligation when it is required by applicable laws, e.g., in order to prevent fraud, assist law protection and enforcement bodies.</p>
<p align="left">(c) Legitimate interest – we have a commercial interest in processing your personal data that is justified, balanced and does not infringe on your privacy (e.g., statistical reporting). Where the legal basis is legitimate interests, you have a right to object to our use of your data. Please see section 8 to find out more;</p>
<p align="left">(d) consent — we may process some of your data when we have your consent to do so. Where the legal basis is consent, you can withdraw consent at any time. Please see section 8 to find out more.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>5.6.&nbsp;</strong>You hereby acknowledge and agree that we may receive your personal data from any third parties (other users, any official bodies, third-party providers, etc.) when you connect your Hily profile with other services, when we receive enquires, court orders, subpoenas, claims, etc.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>5.7.&nbsp;</strong>We do not collect or store full credit card number information, though we may receive credit card-related information to help process future payments and summary information about transactions that do not include credit card or bank account numbers.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>5.8.&nbsp;</strong>From time to time, we may start surveys/feedback for research purposes and we may contact you to find out if you would like to take part. We may also contact you to find out if you would like to take part in marketing campaigns. Such activities are optional. If you do not wish to be contacted to take part in a survey or marketing campaign, please contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fb888e8b8b94898fbb93929782d5989496"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="94e7e1e4e4fbe6e0d4fcfdf8edbaf7fbf9">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> or via the respective in-App feature. If you do not want to contact us but you also do not want to participate in our activities, please ignore our messages.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>5.9.&nbsp;</strong>Since we rely on your consent to show you personalized ads, you are entitled to revoke your consent anytime and request that we stop using personalized ads towards you. Please contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ed9e989d9d829f99ad85848194c38e8280"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7e0d0b0e0e110c0a3e16171207501d1113">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> to strike off your consent. Meanwhile, if you opt-out of targeted advertising you will still see ads, though they will be less relevant to you.</p>

</p>
<p align="left"><strong>6.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Duration and Location of Processing; Cross-Border Data Transfer</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>6.1.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Data Retention</strong>. Your data will be stored within the term of your use of the Services and up to the termination of such use (or upon agreement between you and Hily) which means the deletion, blocking or suspension of your account on the mobile application and the restriction of your further use of the mobile application; we shall terminate the processing of your personal information, unless the special retention period for the storage of such data is set by the relevant legislation at the time.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>6.2.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Exemptions</strong>. We delete or anonymize your information, including sensitive information indicated in section 9.2. for California Residents upon the termination of your profile or after two years of your continuous inactivity. There may be special rules applied in case that:</p>
<p align="left">(a) we must hold your data to comply with applicable laws;</p>
<p align="left">(b) we must hold your data to evidence our compliance with applicable laws;</p>
<p align="left">(c) there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to hold the relevant data until it is resolved; or</p>
<p align="left">(d) your data must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing users’ safety and security (see section 6.6 hereof).</p>
<p align="left"><strong>6.3.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Terms of Deletion</strong>. All your data is to be fully erased (or anonymized) within 7 calendar days following deletion of your Hily profile, except:</p>
<p align="left">(a) livestreams records which are being stored up to 7 calendar days following a date of livestream;</p>
<p align="left">(b) in-app features and subscription purchases which are being retained during the term of your subscription and 5 years from the deletion of your user account;</p>
<p align="left">(c) support tickets, emails with our support team and your name (as identified in your email), as part of support tickets data that are being retained during the term of your subscription and 5 years from the deletion of your user account;</p>
<p align="left">(d) hashed email address, phone number, IP address, profile ID (including, Hily ID, Facebook ID, Snapchat ID, Apple ID) and device ID (<u>NOT</u> a device IMEI) associated with banned account which are being retained during the term of your subscription and 5 years from the deletion of your user account owing to our legitimate interest (see section 6.6 hereof);</p>
<p align="left"><strong>6.4.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Leftovers</strong>. When your account is deleted (as well as your data) from the Services, copies of your data may still be viewable, if your data has been previously shared with others, or copied or stored by other users or other third parties. We cannot control this, nor do we accept any liability for this. If you have given third party applications or websites access to your data, they may retain such information to the extent permitted under their own privacy policies.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>6.5.&nbsp;</strong>Removed and deleted data may be hosted in backup copies for up to 30 days, but will not be available to others in the meantime. We put that backup data ‘beyond use’. At the end of this period, these data will be permanently deleted.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>6.6.&nbsp;</strong>At all times, you are entitled to restrict us from processing your data by sending to us a data erasure request or a notice of prohibition to process your data. Please be warned that:</p>
<p align="left">(a) such action prohibits us from processing your data and/or making us delete your data so you will lose your access to the Website and Services;</p>
<p align="left">(b) if your Hily profile is banned, a data erasure request will not release you from prohibition to use Hily Services;</p>
<p align="left">(c) if your profile is blocked, your other Hily profiles may also be blocked as part of our anti-spam and anti-fraud procedures.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>6.7.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Enforcing of Prohibition to Use Hily</strong>. If your profile is blocked, banned or otherwise disabled owing to any violation of applicable law or a violation of the Terms of Use or the provisions of this Policy, you will be prohibited from further creation of new profiles and using the Services again. Accordingly, we will keep on processing data listed in section 6.3(f) hereof (the “technical data”) in order to prevent your further registration and potential violations. Please note that:</p>
<p align="left">(a) the technical data is not subject to erasing under Article 17 of the GDPR; hence, we will process it on the basis of our legitimate interest, which is a separate ground of processing;</p>
<p align="left">(b) our legitimate interest does not outweigh your right to privacy, because the way that we use the technical data does not significantly impact your privacy, and we have a compelling reason to do so (recital 47 of the GDPR). This reason is to restrict you from breaching yet another obligation under the <a href="https://hily.com/terms?locale=EN">Hily’s Terms of Use</a><u>&nbsp;</u>and potentially harming us or our users;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>6.8.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Location of Servers.&nbsp;</strong>Our servers are based in the USA and EU, so your data may be processed and hosted outside the EU. We inform you that we use EU servers to collect and process EU and UK residents’ data and we use USA servers to collect and process data of users from the rest of the countries. If you are located outside the United States, your information is collected in your country and then transferred to the United States — or to another country in which we (or our affiliates or service providers) operate.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>6.9.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Cross-Border Data Transfer</strong>. The sharing of information laid out in section 5.4 hereof involves cross-border data transfers to the United States of America and other jurisdictions that may have different laws about data processing. if we transfer personal data collected within the EEA to countries with not adequate level of data protection, we use one of the following legal bases: (i) Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission (details available <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/eu-us-data-transfers_en">here</a> (or any new version of contractual clauses issued by a data protection body (if any), or (ii) the European Commission adequacy decisions about certain countries (details available <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en">here</a>).<strong>&nbsp;</strong>We take steps to ensure that the recipient is bound by E.U. Standard Contractual Clauses together with additional safeguards to protect your personal data. You can see a copy of these clauses. In certain situations, the courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those countries might be entitled to access your personal information.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>9.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your data or complying with your request. If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, we may either charge a reasonable fee, taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested, or refuse to act on the request and notify you the reason for refusing the request.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>9.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>You may also use an authorized agent to submit your request. If you do, we may ask for evidence that you have provided the agent valid power of attorney or other written permission to submit requests on your behalf, and we may also take steps to verify your identity. Owing to a sensitive nature of your data, we reserve the right to reject, at any time, requests concerning your data submitted by any third party.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>10.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Notice to Virginia Residents</strong></p>
<p align="left">Consumers residing in Virginia are afforded certain additional rights with respect to their personal information under the <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title59.1/chapter53/" target="_blank">Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act</a> (VCDPA). If you are a Virginia resident, this section applies to you.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>10.1.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Our collection and use of personal information</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>You may find the categories of personal information Hily collects and the purposes and sources for which your personal information is collected in section 5.4 hereof.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>10.2.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Process your sensitive data.&nbsp;</strong>We do process your sensitive data concerning personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, sexual orientation and precise geolocation data. We process these categories of your sensitive information only if you choose to add this information on your profile. You are giving an explicitly consent to our processing when you add certain tags to your profile. Still, all any time, you are entitled to make us stop showing that data to others by deleting relevant tags in your profile settings. You give us consent to process your geolocation data when you allow through your mapping phone service as Google Maps to access your location while you are using our App. Please see section 8. 1 (d) above on how to restrict the processing of your geolocation data.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>10.3.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Exercising your&nbsp;</strong><strong>consumer rights:</strong> You have the right to request (1) to confirm whether or not a controller is processing the consumer's personal data and to access such personal data; (2) To correct inaccuracies in the consumer's personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the purposes of the processing of the consumer's personal data; (3) To delete personal data provided by or obtained about the consumer; (4) To obtain a copy of the consumer's personal data that the consumer previously provided to the controller in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows the consumer to transmit the data to another controller without hindrance, where the processing is carried out by automated means; (5) to opt out of the processing of the personal data for purposes of targeted advertising.</p>
<p align="left">You may exercise your rights by contacting us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6714121717081513270f0e0b1e4904080a"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a2d1d7d2d2cdd0d6e2cacbcedb8cc1cdcf">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. See more details in section 11 below. We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your rights under the VCDPA. You may contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e99a9c9999869b9da981808590c78a8684"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="295a5c5959465b5d6941404550074a4644">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> if you want to appeal Hily`s refusal to take action on your request. The appeal process is conspicuously available and similar to the process for submitting requests. Hily will have 60 days of receipt of an appeal to inform you in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal.</p>
<p align="left">If the appeal is denied, you may contact the Attorney General to submit a complaint.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>10.4.&nbsp;</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>ale of personal information</strong> <strong>and process of personal information for targeted advertising.</strong> We do not sell your personal information. We do not exchange your personal data for monetary consideration with third parties, so no opt-out choice is necessary for that. However, we do process your personal information for targeted advertising in the sense of VCDPA. We display advertisements to you where such adds are based on personal data obtained from nonaffiliated websites or online applications. You can opt out of the processing of the personal data for purposes of targeted advertising by contacting us at <a data-fr-linked="true" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#53202623233c2127133b3a3f2a7d303c3e"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="493a3c3939263b3d0921202530672a2624">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>

</p>
<p align="left"><strong>11.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Data Subjects’ Access and Erasure Requests</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>11.1.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Method for Submitting Requests</strong>. If you are an EU user, you may exercise your right to file a request to access or delete your data by contacting us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2d5e585d5d425f596d45444154034e4240"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="8dfef8fdfde2fff9cde5e4e1f4a3eee2e0">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> or via the App. In the event you are a California or Virginia consumer, you may exercise your privacy rights according to section 9 and 10 accordingly.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>11.2.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Timeframes</strong>. In the event you submit your request to us, we will act as follows:</p>
<p align="left">(a) within 10 business days following а confirmation of receipt of your letter, we shall request that you provide us with relevant data for a verification procedure;</p>
<p align="left">(b) if you are a California or Virginia consumer, we will have 45 calendar days following the date of your request to process your request. In the event of your failure to pass the verification process within 45 calendar days, we may deny your request or prolong the term of processing up to additional 45 calendar days; please be sure that we will notify you about our decision;</p>
<p align="left">(c) if you are an EU or UK user, we will have 30 calendar days following the date that you provide us with the data required for verification to process your request. In the event of your failure to pass the verification process, we may deny your request. We are entitled to prolong the response term up to 2 months by giving you a notification.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>11.3.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Verification and&nbsp;</strong><strong>automated decision-making</strong>. The most important step is the verification process. We will first check that we have enough information to be sure of your identity. Often, we will have no reason to doubt a person’s identity (if you contact us via the App, for example). We use a combination of the automated system and a team of moderators to verify the users` identity and users are not robots. And we also want to avoid fake Hily accounts being created which can be used for malicious activities and cybercrime – they threaten the Hily network and spoil things for everyone. If you choose to verify your profile photo, our automated system will scan each photo that you submit. So, automated decision-making is necessary in order to help ensure that you are who you say you are before entering into a contract with you. This ultimately assists our efforts to prevent and respond to illegal, malicious, and unauthorized activity. We do not add the verification photos to your profile.</p>
<p align="left">If we have good grounds to doubt your identity, we may ask you to provide additional evidence we reasonably need to confirm your identity. For example, we may ask you for a piece of information held in your profile that we would expect you to know: your location, last 5 connections, etc. If we have serious doubts about your identity, we may ask you to share with Hily your photo with your ID document or an image of your ID document. In the event you fail the verification process, your request will be rejected.</p>
