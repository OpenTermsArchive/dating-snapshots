<li
dir=ltr aria-level=1><p
dir=ltr>Mandatory Arbitration. Please read this Section carefully. YOU AND HILY, AND EACH OF OUR RESPECTIVE AGENTS, CORPORATE PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, AGREE TO ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AS THE EXCLUSIVE FORM OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR BELOW, FOR ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICE, UNLESS YOU ARE LOCATED IN A JURISDICTION THAT PROHIBITS THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF ARBITRATION FOR DISPUTE RESOLUTION. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Please visit www.adr.org for more information about arbitration.</p>
</li>
<li
dir=ltr aria-level=1><p
dir=ltr>Commencing Arbitration. A party intending to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by an international courier with a tracking mechanism, a written notice of intent to arbitrate (a “Notice”), or, in the absence of a mailing address provided by you to Hily, via any other method available to Hily, including via e-mail. The Notice to Hily must be addressed to Hily Corp. (Rainbow Boulevard #1132, Las Vegas, NV 89108; file number: 6408961), Attn: Chief Executive Officer (the &#8220;Arbitration Notice Address&#8221;). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (the &#8220;Demand&#8221;). If you and Hily do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, then you or Hily may commence an arbitration proceeding as set forth below or file a claim in small claims court. THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (&#8220;AAA&#8221;) WILL ADMINISTER THE ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES (THE &#8220;Rules&#8221;), AS MODIFIED BY THIS AGREEMENT. The Rules and AAA forms are available online at http://www.adr.org. If you are required to pay a filing fee to commence an arbitration against Hily, then Hily will promptly reimburse you for your confirmed payment of the filing fee upon Hily&#8217;s receipt of a Notice at the Arbitration Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration along with a receipt evidencing payment of the filing fee, unless your Demand is equal to or greater than $1,000 or was filed in bad faith, in which case you are solely responsible for the payment of the filing fee.</p>
</li>
<li
dir=ltr aria-level=1><p
dir=ltr>Arbitration Proceeding. The arbitration will be in English. A single independent and impartial arbitrator with his or her primary place of business in San Francisco, California will be appointed pursuant to the Rules, as modified herein. You and Hily agree to comply with the following rules, which are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the costs and burdens on the parties: (i) the arbitration will be conducted online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (ii) the arbitration will not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties; and (iii) any judgment on the award the arbitrator renders may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
</li>
<li
dir=ltr aria-level=1><p
dir=ltr>No Class Actions. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER LAW, YOU AND HILY AGREE THAT YOU AND HILY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. FURTHER, YOU AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON&#8217;S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND THAT IF THIS SPECIFIC PROVISO IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION SECTION WILL BE NULL AND VOID.</p>
</li>
<li
dir=ltr aria-level=1><p
dir=ltr>Decision of the Arbitrator. Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator will issue his or her decision within 120 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days in the interests of justice. All arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and confidential, and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. The award of the arbitrator will be in writing and will include a statement setting forth the reasons for the disposition of any claim. The arbitrator will apply the laws of the State of California in conducting the arbitration. You acknowledge that these terms and your use of the Service evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. The United States Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to this Section 16.</p>
</li>
<li
dir=ltr aria-level=1><p
dir=ltr>Equitable Relief. The foregoing provisions of this Section 16 do not apply to any claim in which either party seeks equitable relief to protect such party’s copyrights, trademarks, or patents. For the avoidance of doubt, however, you acknowledge that, in the event Hily or a third party breaches this Agreement, the damage or harm, if any, caused to you will not entitle you to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against Hily, and your only remedy will be for monetary damages, subject to the limitations of liability set forth in this Agreement.</p>
</li>
<li
dir=ltr aria-level=1><p
dir=ltr>Claims. You and Hily agree that, notwithstanding any other rights a party may have under law or equity, any cause of action arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Service, excluding a claim for indemnification, must commence within one year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.</p>
</li>
<li
dir=ltr aria-level=1><p
dir=ltr>Improperly Filed Claims. All claims you bring against Hily must be resolved in accordance with this Section. All claims filed or brought contrary to this Section will be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to this Section, Hily may recover attorneys&#8217; fees and reimbursement of its costs, provided that Hily has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.</p>
</li>
<li
dir=ltr aria-level=1><p
dir=ltr>Modifications. In the event that Hily makes any future change to the &#8220;Mandatory Arbitration&#8221; paragraph set forth above (other than a change to Hily&#8217;s Arbitration Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to Hily&#8217;s Arbitration Notice Address, in which case your account with Hily and your license to use the Service will terminate immediately, and this Section, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, will survive the termination of this Agreement.</p>
</li>
<li
dir=ltr aria-level=1><p
dir=ltr>Enforceability. If only the &#8220;No Class Actions&#8221; paragraph above or the entirety of this Section 16 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 16 will be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 17 or Section 17-1 will govern any action arising out of or related to this Agreement.</p>
